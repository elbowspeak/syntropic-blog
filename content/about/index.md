description: "Joshua, CEO of S37"
---

I'm Joshua. I live in Seattle.

I run [S37](https://s37.ai), a consulting practice that helps organizations navigate complexity using AI, Active Inference, design thinking, and complex systems approaches to make better decisions under uncertainty.

I'm on the Science Advisory Board at the [Active Inference Institute](https://activeinference.org).

Before this, I was CEO of a startup that used Active Inference to predict energy market price spikes before they happened.

## What I care about

I think the most interesting problems are coordination problems. How do organisms, organizations, and markets stay coherent by channeling entropy? What can we learn from biology about intelligence? How do we build tools that reduce the energy cost of maintaining complex systems?

These questions run through everything I do: the consulting, volunteering, investing, and [writing](/posts/) I do here.
