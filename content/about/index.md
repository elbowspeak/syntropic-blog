## What I care about

I think the most interesting problems are coordination problems. How do organisms, organizations, and markets stay coherent? What can we learn from biology about intelligence? How do we build tools that reduce the cognitive and energy costs of maintaining complex systems?

These questions run through everything I do: consulting, volunteering, investing, and the [writing](/posts/) I do here.
