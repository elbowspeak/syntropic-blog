title: "Intelligence Isn't the Constraint"

description: "How AI collaboration closes the execution gap for individuals and teams"

**tl;dr:** AI collaboration has removed the ADHD friction between having ideas and producing finished work. The same dynamic applies to organizations: the constraint is rarely intelligence, it's the bandwidth between insight and action. AI adds a delegation layer that compresses that gap, freeing the thinking that was already there to finally produce.

In college I figured out that I had ADD (as it was starting to be called then). Much later, in middle age, I got the formal diagnosis, tried medication but didn't like it. For most of my adult life I've compensated with calendars, systems, and the kind of elaborate personal infrastructure that looks like discipline from the outside but is actually a coping mechanism for a brain that won't do what you tell it to. I've always had more ideas than I could actually bring into the world, because the grind of turning an insight into a finished artifact (an essay, a framework, a working tool) required exactly the kind of sustained, linear focus my brain doesn't do. That's where my ideas went to die.

Working with AI collapsed that distance. The low-novelty slog of getting from "I see this clearly" to "here it is on a page, organized and complete" became a conversation. The bottleneck moved from the thing I'm worst at to the thing I'm best at: rapid ideation, pattern recognition, judgment, refinement. In the last few months I've written essays that have been percolating for years. I've built working applications, including this publishing platform and an autonomous intelligence system called Kayt. I've built integrations for clients that replaced months of manual work, turned long-held intuitions into consulting frameworks, and compressed a digitization project from months to weeks. The ideas were there. The capacity to act on them wasn't.

## The organizational version

Here's why I'm telling you this on what is ostensibly a professional site: the constraint I just described is the same one I see in every organization I work with, just at a different scale.

A mid-market leadership team doesn't have ADHD, but it has an execution gap that looks structurally identical. There are more priorities than the team can pursue at the same time. The important work keeps losing to the urgent work. Insights that someone clearly sees never get turned into analysis, never get pressure-tested, never become the basis for a decision, because the grind of doing that work exceeds the organization's available bandwidth. Everyone who knows how is already buried.

This is how organizations get stuck. They have the intelligence, but the distance between what they can perceive and what they can act on is just too large. The standard consulting response is to throw bodies at this: analysts, strategy firms, commissioned reports, etc. These work, sort of, but they're expensive, slow, and create a dependency. When the consultants leave, the execution gap reopens.

## What the delegation layer looks like

AI collaboration compresses the distance between insight and artifact. The thinking stays human. The grind gets delegated.

Think about competitive intelligence. Most companies know they should be tracking competitors, market signals, regulatory shifts. Almost none do it well, because doing it well is a full-time job and in a mid-market company nobody has that job. With the right infrastructure, that work runs continuously, scanning sources, filtering against explicit models of what matters and why, producing synthesis a decision-maker can review, challenge, and act on.

Or take strategic analysis: a leadership team suspects their pricing model is leaving money on the table, but testing that hypothesis means pulling data from three systems, building a model, running scenarios. A month of work for someone who has twelve other things to do. With AI collaboration, that compresses to days. The team's job becomes interrogating the model and making the call. In both cases, the cognitive mode shifts from "can we find time to do this" to "here's the analysis, what do we think."

## The pattern

Individual, team, organization: the constraint is rarely intelligence. It's the bandwidth between intelligence and action. Ideas, insights, strategic awareness are abundant. Execution capacity is scarce.

AI adds a delegation layer that compresses the space between perception and artifact. For me, that meant a brain full of essays and frameworks that could finally exist outside my head. For an organization, it means a leadership team that can actually pursue the strategic work they've been deferring for immediate priorities.

The people and teams I want to work with are the ones who feel this gap. Who know they're capable of more than they're producing.

That friction is dissolving. We can do so much more now.
