I've had ADHD my whole life. I figured it out in college, got the formal diagnosis much later, tried medication and couldn't sleep, too buzzy, not for me. So I managed it through sheer structural overcompensation. Calendars, systems, the kind of elaborate personal infrastructure that looks like discipline from the outside but is actually a coping mechanism for a brain that won't do what you tell it to.

Here's what that meant in practice: I always had more ideas than I could execute. The gap between having an insight and turning it into something (an essay, a framework, a working tool) was enormous. The thinking was easy. The grind was the problem. The part where you sit down and push words around a screen for hours, maintaining focus on a single thread while your brain throws up seventeen more interesting threads it would rather chase. That's where my ideas went to die.

And when the bottleneck got too frustrating, I'd do what every ADHD brain does. Seek stimulation elsewhere. New music, YouTube cycling content, geopolitical rabbit holes. The alternative was staring at a document I couldn't make myself finish, feeling the gap between what I knew I could produce and what I was actually producing. That gap is corrosive. It erodes your sense of yourself as someone who executes.

Working with Claude (conversational AI and Claude Code together) collapsed the distance between conception and artifact in a way that fundamentally changed what my brain can do. It eliminated the part of the process my brain couldn't do: the sustained, linear, low-novelty grind of getting from "I see this clearly" to "here it is on a page, organized and complete." That middle section became a conversation instead of a slog. The bottleneck moved from the thing I'm worst at to the thing I'm best at: rapid ideation, pattern recognition, judgment, refinement.

I've written more in the last six months than in the previous several years combined. I've built working applications despite not being a developer. I've turned intuitions that had been sitting inert for years into frameworks that clients actually use. None of it is Claude's thinking. It's mine. But it wouldn't exist without a collaboration layer that converts the way my brain actually works into finished artifacts.

## The organizational version of this problem

Here's why I'm telling you this on what is ostensibly a professional site: the constraint I just described isn't unique to ADHD. It's the same constraint I see in every organization I work with, just wearing different clothes.

A mid-market leadership team doesn't have an attention deficit disorder. But it has an execution gap that looks structurally identical. There are more priorities than the team can pursue at the same time. The important work keeps losing to the urgent work. Insights that someone on the team clearly sees never get turned into analysis, never get pressure-tested, never become the basis for a decision, because the grind of doing that work exceeds the organization's available bandwidth. The ideas die in the same middle section where mine used to die, just at a different scale.

This is what I mean when I talk about organizations being stuck. They have the intelligence. The distance between what they can perceive and what they can act on is just too large. They can see the competitive threat, or the market shift, or the misalignment between their strategy and their operations. They often can't do the analytical work to confirm it, frame it, and respond to it. Everyone who knows how is already buried in the previous quarter's priorities.

The standard consulting response is to throw bodies at this. Hire analysts. Bring in a strategy firm. Commission a report. These work, sort of, but they're expensive, slow, and create a dependency that doesn't build internal capability. When the consultants leave, the execution gap reopens.

## What the delegation layer actually looks like

AI collaboration changes this the same way it changed my writing process. By compressing the distance between insight and artifact. The thinking stays human. The grind gets delegated.

Consider competitive intelligence. Most companies know they should be tracking what their competitors are doing, what the market is signaling, where the regulatory environment is shifting. Almost none of them do it well, because doing it well requires someone to read hundreds of sources, filter for signal quality, synthesize across domains, and produce analysis that's current enough to act on. That's a full-time job, and in a mid-market company, nobody has that job. So it doesn't happen, or it happens in someone's spare time and produces something stale.

With the right AI infrastructure, that work runs continuously. Scanning hundreds of sources, filtering against explicit models of what matters and why, producing synthesis in a form that a decision-maker can review, challenge, and act on. The human contribution shifts from grinding through sources to exercising judgment on what the sources mean. The same shift I experienced personally, where the bottleneck moves from the tedious middle to the high-cognition endpoint.

Or take strategic analysis. A leadership team suspects that their pricing model is leaving money on the table, but testing that hypothesis requires pulling together data from three systems, building a model, running scenarios, and presenting findings. A month of work for someone who has twelve other things to do. In practice, the analysis never happens. The team decides on instinct, or they defer the decision, which is its own kind of decision.

With AI collaboration, that month compresses to days. The work of assembling data, building initial models, and generating scenario analyses can be delegated. The team's job becomes interrogating the model, stress-testing assumptions, and making the call. The cognitive mode shifts from "can we find time to do this analysis" to "here's the analysis, what do we think."

## The pattern underneath

The pattern is the same at every scale. Individual, team, organization: the constraint is rarely intelligence. It's the bandwidth between intelligence and action. Ideas, insights, strategic awareness are abundant. What's scarce is the execution capacity to turn them into artifacts that can be tested against reality.

AI doesn't add intelligence to the system. It adds a delegation layer that compresses the grind between perception and artifact. This frees the intelligence that was already there to operate at its actual level. For me, that meant a brain full of essays and frameworks that could finally exist outside my head. For an organization, it means a leadership team that can actually pursue the strategic work they've been deferring for quarters.

The people and teams I want to work with are the ones who feel this gap. Who know they're capable of more than they're producing. Who have strategic clarity that isn't translating into strategic action because the operational cost of doing it exceeds their available capacity.

That friction is dissolving. So much more can be done now.
