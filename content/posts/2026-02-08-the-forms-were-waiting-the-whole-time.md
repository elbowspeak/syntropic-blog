Evolution has a creation myth, and like most creation myths it flatters the storyteller. The myth goes: mutation provides random variation, selection filters for fitness, and over geological time the accumulation of filtered randomness produces the appearance of design. Variation has no direction. Any form is possible in principle. Selection, working after the fact, winnows the infinite space of possibilities down to what we actually observe. The canvas on which life paints is blank.

It's an elegant story, but it's wrong in a way that matters.

If fitness is downstream of thermodynamics, if forms persist and leave descendants because they dissipate energy more efficiently (which I argued at length in the companion essay, [Meditations on the God of Spinoza](https://syntropic.xyz/posts/2026-02-01-meditations-on-spinoza-s-god/)), then the canvas cannot be blank. **Morphospace**, that abstract landscape of every possible biological form, must have structure baked into it before any organism arrives to explore. Some configurations are easier to maintain than others. Some arrangements of matter dissipate gradients more efficiently than their neighbors. These configurations don't need to be invented by evolution. They are already there, written into the physics, waiting as valleys in a landscape that no lineage has yet traversed.

Michael Levin's bioelectricity research provides the clearest window into this pre-existing structure.¹ His planarian experiments demonstrate something that should unsettle anyone committed to the standard story: you can manipulate the bioelectric pattern in a flatworm fragment, without touching the genome, and cause it to regenerate as a different species' head shape. A flatworm that has looked the same way for hundreds of millions of years suddenly produces a head configuration it has never developed, not because the configuration was engineered, but because it was **accessed**. The two-headed planarian, the four-headed planarian, the planarian wearing another species' face: these forms were always available as regions in morphospace where stability comes easier, coordinates on a map that this particular lineage had simply never visited.

Levin calls this "Platonic morphospace," which captures the intuition that forms exist prior to their instantiation. But "Platonic" risks making the whole thing more mysterious than it needs to be. We don't need the forms to reside in some ethereal realm of ideals. The simpler framing is thermodynamic: certain configurations of biological matter fit together without constant struggle, maintain themselves without burning through resources fighting internal contradictions, persist because the parts cooperate rather than interfere. I think of these as entropic Schelling points.

### The Focal Point

A Schelling point, in game theory, is a solution that people converge on without explicit coordination. If two strangers need to meet somewhere in Manhattan and can't communicate, they're likely to both choose Grand Central Station, not because it's optimal in any abstract sense, but because it's the obvious focal point given shared knowledge of the space. The station stands out. It has a salience that other locations lack, and that salience does the coordinating work that explicit communication would otherwise need to do.

Entropic Schelling points work the same way, but the "players" are the components of a dissipative system trying to maintain its form, and the "shared knowledge" is the physics of far-from-equilibrium thermodynamics. Certain configurations of biological matter stand out as focal points because they represent efficient solutions to the problem of maintaining organization while dissipating energy. The components don't coordinate explicitly, cells don't negotiate with each other about what body plan to build, and yet they converge on these configurations because the physics of dissipation makes them attractor states, valleys in the landscape that you roll into once you get close enough to the rim.

What organisms do when they develop, then, is not build from a blueprint. They navigate a pre-structured landscape, falling into basins that exist independent of their particular evolutionary history. The genome doesn't specify the form; it encodes parameters that bias the system toward one basin rather than another. The basins themselves are defined by physics. The genome is less an architect's drawing and more a set of directions to a particular valley: go north past the ridge, bear left at the fork, and you'll end up somewhere that works.

###  The Explorer

The Watson, Levin, and Lewens paper on "natural induction" provides the mechanism that makes this navigation possible, and it's more general than anyone expected.²˒³ They show that any dynamical system with viscoelastic connections, connections that give way slightly under stress like a rubber band that stretches and doesn't quite return to its original length, will spontaneously exhibit learning-like behavior. Not metaphorically. The mathematics is identical.

The key is a difference in timescales. When a system encounters stress, whether injury or environmental pressure or the demands of regeneration, it responds quickly, settling into whatever stable state is available given its current configuration. But the connections between its components adjust slowly in the background, accumulating a residue of what the system has been through. Each encounter with stress leaves a trace, and those traces reshape which stable states the system can access next time. The system learns, in the most literal sense: its history of interaction with the world changes its future behavior.

This matters enormously because it means organisms can discover stable configurations on their own, within a single lifetime, without waiting for selection to filter across generations. Selection operates slowly, sifting which organisms persist over evolutionary time. Induction operates fast, reshaping a system's internal landscape as it responds to the pressures it actually faces. Induction is the explorer; selection curates what the explorer finds.

In the planarian, the mechanism is recursive in a way that collapses the distinction between memory and action. Ion channels create voltage gradients across cell membranes. Gap junctions allow those voltages to propagate between cells, creating tissue-wide bioelectric patterns. And both the channels and the junctions are themselves voltage-sensitive, opening and closing in response to the very gradients they create. The network that stores the pattern is the same network that reads and enacts it. There is no separate blueprint and builder. The bioelectric state is both the map and the territory, the score and the orchestra, the memory and the act of remembering.

Think of it as a palimpsest, one of those medieval manuscripts where monks scraped away older text to write new scripture over it, but the older writing was never fully erased and keeps showing through. Each round of stress and recovery writes a new layer onto the bioelectric network, and each layer partially overwrites but never fully erases what came before. The result is a manuscript thick with accumulated history, where the current text is shaped by every text that preceded it and the whole document actively determines what can be written next. This is stigmergy: coordination through traces left in a shared medium, the same principle by which ant colonies build elaborate structures through nothing more than individual ants responding to pheromone trails laid down by other ants. No architect. No blueprint. Just traces, responses, and the accumulation of history into structure.

The bioelectric palimpsest encodes something like a grammar of form, not a specification that says "build a head here" but a set of rules about what can go with what. Two heads? The grammar allows it, and Levin has demonstrated as much. A head where the tail should be? Also grammatically valid. But a configuration where the bioelectric signals would fight each other, where maintaining the pattern would require constant expenditure against internal contradiction? The grammar rules it out. The entropic Schelling points are precisely the configurations the grammar permits, the forms where everything fits together and the parts don't work at cross purposes.

### Why Eyes Keep Happening

Convergent evolution has always been treated as a curiosity in need of explanation: how remarkable that eyes evolved independently dozens of times, that flight was invented separately by insects, pterosaurs, birds, and bats, that echolocation arose independently in dolphins and bats. The standard explanation invokes similar selection pressures: vision is useful, so natural selection independently arrived at similar solutions in different lineages.

But this explanation is weaker than it sounds. Lots of traits would be useful that haven't evolved repeatedly. Wheels would be useful for locomotion. Biological radio communication would be useful for coordination. The question isn't whether a trait is useful but whether the physics of biological materials permits a stable, maintainable configuration that performs the function. And for light detection, it turns out there are only so many ways to convert photons into nerve signals using the molecular toolkit that carbon chemistry provides. The eye is an entropic Schelling point, a focal configuration that different lineages stumble into because the thermodynamic landscape keeps funneling them there. The "eye attractor" exists in morphospace independent of any lineage's history, a valley so deep and so accessible that any developmental system exploring nearby terrain will eventually roll into it.

The same logic scales up and down. Body plans cluster into roughly three dozen phyla because the physics of moving, feeding, and maintaining structural integrity in a gravity well constrains what macroscopic architectures actually work, and those constraints are thermodynamic, not evolutionary. Metabolic networks across all domains of life converge on similar core pathways, glycolysis and the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, because carbon chemistry in aqueous solution has a limited number of efficient energy-extraction routes. Each of these is a deep basin in the relevant morphospace, a configuration so thermodynamically favorable that independent explorers keep finding it.

Natural induction is what carries each lineage into these basins. Selection didn't design the eye; natural induction found it, reshaping internal connections under the pressure of environmental demands until the system settled into a configuration that worked, and selection kept it. The explorer discovers; the curator preserves.

This is perhaps why we shouldn't expect alien life, if it exists, to be arbitrarily alien. Any dissipative system complex enough to metabolize, move, and process information faces similar thermodynamic constraints, which means similar attractor landscapes, which means similar Schelling points. The universe may have fewer viable body plans than science fiction imagines, not because of any failure of imagination but because physics constrains the possible more tightly than we assumed. The aliens, if we meet them, might look disturbingly familiar, not because of some cosmic coincidence but because the landscape they explored has the same valleys ours does.

### Basins and Boundaries

### 

Once you see morphospace as a landscape of basins, several old puzzles dissolve or at least change shape in useful ways.

Evolvability, the capacity of a lineage to generate adaptive variation, becomes a question of geography. A system sitting near the boundary between two basins can access new forms with small perturbations (the adjacent possible); just a nudge can send it rolling into a neighboring valley. 

A system deep in a basin's center is stable, which sounds like a limitation until you realize that depth reflects quality. Sharks have looked roughly like sharks for four hundred million years because they landed on a near-global optimum for being a fast predator in water. The depth of their basin reflects how thoroughly that form resolves the constraints of their niche, and the absence of change reflects not stagnation but the absence of anywhere better to go. Lineages at shallow attractors keep rolling; lineages at deep ones stay put because staying put is what success looks like.

Development becomes navigation rather than construction. The embryo doesn't build a body from a set of instructions; it moves through a landscape of bioelectric and chemical gradients, settling into whichever valley it reaches. The body it builds is whichever valley it finds, and the genome's role is to set the initial conditions and biases that determine which valley that will be.

Through this lens, cancer becomes coherence collapse; cells lose their connection to the tissue-level bioelectric pattern that kept them participating in the multicellular project, and revert to an older and deeper way of being. The ancient pattern of single-celled life has been a stable attractor far longer than multicellularity has existed; it is the deepest basin in the biological landscape, the one that was there first and has never been filled in. When the newer writing on the palimpsest fades, when the organizational signals that maintain the tissue-level pattern weaken or break down, the older text shows through. Metastasis is what this looks like in practice: cells that have stopped cooperating with the organism and returned to the unicellular imperative of migrate, consume, reproduce. They haven't learned a new trick. They've remembered an ancient one.

### The Bargain

The deepest insight in all of this is that entropy and organization aren't opposed, and never were. The old framing, order versus chaos, life versus entropy, complexity clinging to existence against the cosmic tide, gets the relationship exactly backwards. Far-from-equilibrium systems maintain their organization **_through_** entropy production, not against it. They persist because they have found configurations that dissipate energy gradients efficiently enough to sustain their own improbable structure. The Schelling points in morphospace are precisely those configurations where this bargain works, where the system's persistence and the universe's entropy budget are aligned rather than in tension.

Life, in this framing, is matter falling into entropic Schelling points and staying there. Natural induction is the explorer, reshaping internal connections until systems settle into configurations that work. Selection curates which explorations persist across generations. Development is the trajectory through morphospace as each new organism settles into its basin. And convergent evolution, the independent discovery of similar solutions by unrelated lineages separated by hundreds of millions of years and thousands of miles of ocean, is the signature of structure that was always already there. Thermodynamic focal points that different explorers find because the landscape itself makes them salient, valleys that keep catching whoever wanders close.

The forms were always waiting. Physics wrote them into the substrate before any genome existed to discover them.

### What's Next

What I want to know next, and what I'll take up in a subsequent essay, is whether the same logic extends beyond biology. Does human social morphospace have entropic Schelling points? Do markets, legal systems, and organizational forms fall into thermodynamically favored configurations the way bodies do? The substrate is different, attention and trust rather than bioelectricity, but the question is structurally identical: is the space of possible social arrangements pre-structured by physics, and are we navigating a landscape rather than designing from scratch?

I suspect the answer is yes, and that most of our political arguments amount to disagreements about which basin we're in and whether the neighboring one is actually better or just looks that way from the rim.
