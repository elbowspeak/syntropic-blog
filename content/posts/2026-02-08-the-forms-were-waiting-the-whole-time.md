The standard story of evolutionary innovation goes something like this: mutation provides random variation, selection filters for fitness, and over geological time the accumulation of filtered randomness produces the appearance of design. The key assumption is that variation itself has no direction, that any form is possible in principle; it's only selection, working after the fact, that winnows the space of possibilities down to what we actually see. The space of possible forms is treated as a blank canvas.

But as I argued in the companion essay, [Meditations on the God of Spinoza](https://syntropic.xyz/posts/2026-02-01-meditations-on-spinoza-s-god/), 'fitness' is downstream of thermodynamics: forms persist and leave descendants because they dissipate energy more efficiently. If that's true, then the canvas can't be blank. **Morphospace**, the space of possible biological forms, must have structure: basins and attractors that exist independently of any particular lineage's exploration. Some configurations are easier to maintain than others, and those are the ones that show up repeatedly.

Michael Levin's bioelectricity research provides the clearest window into this structure.¹ His planarian experiments demonstrate something remarkable: you can manipulate the bioelectric pattern in a flatworm fragment and cause it to regenerate as a different species' head shape without touching the genome. The form wasn't invented; it was accessed. The two-headed planarian configuration was always there, waiting as regions in morphospace where stability comes easier, even though planaria had never arrived at those coordinates in hundreds of millions of years.

Levin calls this 'Platonic morphospace,' which captures the intuition that **forms exist prior to their instantiation**. But 'Platonic' risks making it more mysterious than it needs to be. The simpler framing is thermodynamic: some configurations are easier to maintain than others because the parts fit together without constant struggle. I think of these as **entropic Schelling points**.

***

A Schelling point, in game theory, is a solution that people converge on without explicit coordination, a natural meeting place that stands out from alternatives because of some salient feature. If two strangers need to meet somewhere in Manhattan without communicating, they're likely to both choose Grand Central Station. Not because it's optimal in any abstract sense, but because it's the obvious focal point given shared knowledge of the space.

Entropic Schelling points work similarly, but the "players" are the components of a dissipative system maintaining its form, and the "shared knowledge" is the physics of far-from-equilibrium thermodynamics. Certain configurations stand out as focal points because they represent efficient solutions to the problem of maintaining organization. Components don't need to coordinate explicitly; they converge on these configurations because the physics of dissipation makes them attractor states.

This reframes what organisms are doing when they develop. They are navigating a pre-structured landscape, falling into basins that exist independent of their particular evolutionary history. The genome encodes parameters that bias the system toward one basin rather than another, while the basins themselves are defined by physics.

***

The Watson, Levin, and Lewens paper on 'natural induction' provides the mechanistic substrate for this picture.²˒³ They show that any dynamical system with viscoelastic connections (connections that give way slightly under stress) will spontaneously exhibit learning-like behavior.

The key insight is about adaptive timescales of selection vs induction. Selection operates across generations, slowly filtering which organisms persist. But induction operates within a single lifetime, reshaping a system's internal connections as it responds to stress. The system settles into stable states quickly, while its connections adjust slowly in the background, accumulating a kind of memory. Why does this matter? Because the organism can discover stable configurations on its own, without waiting for selection to filter across generations. Induction explores morphospace faster than selection can.

This reshaping process leaves traces. When the planarian encounters stress, whether injury, environmental pressure, or the demands of regeneration, the connections in its bioelectric network give way and reform. Each adjustment deposits a residue of what the system has been through.

The mechanism is recursive: ion channels create voltage gradients, gap junctions allow those voltages to propagate between cells, and both channels and junctions are themselves voltage-sensitive. So the network that stores the pattern is the same network that reads and enacts it. There's no separate memory and actor; the bioelectric state is both.

Like a palimpsest accumulating layers of text, or a trail worn into grass by repeated walking, the structure becomes a record of its own history that actively shapes what happens next. This is stigmergy: coordination through traces left in a shared medium.

***

Here's where it connects to morphospace: The planarian's bioelectric network, shaped by its history of stress and recovery, encodes which body configurations are easy to reach and which aren't. This isn't a blueprint that specifies 'build a head here.' It's more like a grammar: rules about what can go with what. Two heads? The grammar allows it. A head where the tail should be? Also allowed.

But a configuration where the parts can't coordinate, where the bioelectric signals would fight each other? The grammar rules it out. The Schelling points are the configurations the grammar permits, the forms where everything fits together without the parts working against each other.

In this framing, convergent evolution stops being surprising. Eyes evolved independently dozens of times, not because vision is generically useful (lots of useful things haven't evolved repeatedly), but because there are only so many ways to turn light into nerve signals using biological materials. The eye is a Schelling point: a solution that different lineages stumble into because the physics keeps pointing there. The "eye attractor" exists in morphospace independent of any lineage's history. Lineages fall into it when their environment demands light-sensing and their developmental machinery gets close enough to the basin.

The same logic extends beyond eyes. Body plans cluster into roughly three dozen phyla because the physics of moving, feeding, and maintaining structural integrity in a gravity well constrains what macroscopic architectures actually work. Metabolic networks across all domains of life converge on similar core pathways (glycolysis, the citric acid cycle) because carbon chemistry in aqueous solution has a limited number of efficient energy-extraction routes. Each of these is a case where independent lineages, facing similar constraints, fell into similar solutions.

Natural induction is the explorer here. It's the process by which each lineage's internal connections reshape under stress until the system settles into one of these configurations. Selection didn't design the eye; natural induction found it, and selection kept it.

(This might also be why we shouldn't expect alien life, if it exists, to be arbitrarily alien. Any dissipative system complex enough to metabolize, move, and process information faces similar thermodynamic constraints, which means similar attractors in morphospace. The universe may have fewer viable forms than science fiction imagines.)

***

The implication is that these solutions weren't selected from an infinite space of possibilities. They were discovered by induction in a space that was already structured, a landscape with grooves and valleys that channel exploration toward certain configurations.

Selection still matters but its role changes. It biases which basins organisms are likely to visit, which attractor they'll fall into when perturbed. Mutation serves as a perturbation that occasionally kicks the system from one basin into the catchment of another. But the basins themselves were there before any organism existed to find them.

***

This reframes several old puzzles. Evolvability becomes a question of position in the landscape: a dissipative system that sits near the boundaries between basins can access new forms with small pushes, while one deep in a basin's center is stable; it would take a major perturbation to dislodge it. Natural induction is what moves a system through this landscape, reshaping connections until it finds a new resting point. But that stability isn't a limitation; it's a sign the system has found something worth keeping.

A deep basin means a good solution. Sharks have looked roughly like sharks for four hundred million years because they landed on a near-global optimum for being a fast predator in water. The depth of the basin reflects how well the form resolves the constraints of its niche. Lineages at shallow attractors keep rolling; lineages at deep ones stay put because there's nowhere better to go.

Development becomes navigation: bioelectric fields and chemical gradients create a landscape of possibilities, and the embryo settles into one of its valleys. The body it builds is whichever valley it finds.

Cancer becomes coherence collapse: cells losing connection to the organizational signals that keep them participating in the tissue-level pattern. Without those signals, they revert to older, deeper ways of being: the ancient pattern of single-celled life, which has been a stable attractor far longer than multicellularity has existed.

Metastasis is what this looks like in practice: cells that have stopped cooperating with the organism and returned to the unicellular imperative of migrate, consume, reproduce. Like a palimpsest where the newer writing fades and the older text shows through.

***

The deeper point is that entropy and organization aren't opposed. Far-from-equilibrium systems maintain their organization through the second law, by finding configurations that create entropy efficiently enough to sustain their improbable structural stability. The Schelling points in morphospace are precisely those configurations where this bargain works, where the system can persist because it has found an efficient way to dissipate the gradients that drive it.

Life, in this framing, is matter falling into entropic Schelling points and staying there. Natural induction is the explorer, reshaping internal connections until systems settle into stable configurations. Selection is the filter, determining which explorations persist. Development is the trajectory through morphospace as a system settles into its basin. And convergence, the independent discovery of similar solutions by unrelated lineages, is the signature of structure that was always already there, thermodynamic focal points that different explorers find because the landscape itself makes them salient.

The forms were always waiting. Physics wrote them into the substrate before any genome existed to discover them.

***

### What's Next?

Does human social morphospace have entropic Schelling points? Do markets, legal systems, and organizational forms fall into thermodynamically favored configurations the way bodies do? The substrate is different -- attention and trust rather than bioelectricity -- but the question is the same.

Stay tuned.
