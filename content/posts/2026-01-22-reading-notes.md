A few things I've been reading lately, with brief commentary.

## Books

**"Thinking in Systems" by Donella Meadows**

A classic introduction to systems thinking that I finally got around to reading. Meadows has a gift for making abstract concepts concrete. Her list of "leverage points"—places where small interventions can produce large changes—is worth the price of admission alone.

Key insight: The least effective leverage points are the ones we focus on most (parameters like taxes and subsidies). The most effective ones are the hardest to change (paradigms and goals).

**"The Beginning of Infinity" by David Deutsch**

Dense, ambitious, and occasionally frustrating. Deutsch argues that human progress depends on good explanations—hard-to-vary accounts of how things work. His optimism about the reach of human knowledge is bracing, even if some of his claims seem overconfident.

I keep returning to his distinction between *rules of thumb* and *deep explanations*. The former work until they don't; the latter tell you why.

## Papers

**"Attention Is All You Need" (Vaswani et al., 2017)**

Yes, I know I'm late to this one. Re-reading it in 2026, what strikes me is how much was implicit in this paper that took years to unfold. The transformer architecture contained the seeds of everything that followed, but no one—including the authors—could have predicted exactly how.

This is emergence in action: a technical contribution whose implications exceeded its creators' understanding.

## Articles

**"The Bitter Lesson" by Rich Sutton**

Sutton argues that the history of AI shows one consistent pattern: methods that leverage computation scale beat methods that leverage human knowledge. He's probably right, and the implications are humbling.

If general methods + scale beat specialized insight, what does that say about the value of human expertise in the long run?

What are you reading? I'm always looking for recommendations.
