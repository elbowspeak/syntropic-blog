description: "Joshua Shane: building tools for navigating complexity"
---

I'm Joshua. I build tools and systems, and I write about prediction, information, and coherence: the patterns that let complex systems persist by serving entropy.

Currently: CEO of [S37](https://s37.ai), Science Advisory Board member at the [Active Inference Institute](https://activeinference.org), AI strategy and integration at [Xtract](https://xtract360.com), consigliere to leaders, volunteer for non-profits. Previously built an energy market prediction startup.

I write [essays](/posts/) on intelligence, entropy, and the philosophy of complex systems, and shorter [writing](/writing/) about AI strategy and organizational intelligence.
