description: "Joshua Shane: building tools for navigating complexity"
---

I'm Joshua. I build tools and systems, and I write about prediction, information, and coherence – the patterns complex systems use to emerge and grow.

I run [S37](https://s37.ai), sit on the Science Advisory Board at the [Active Inference Institute](https://activeinference.org), lead AI strategy and integration at [Xtract](https://xtract360.com), consigliere to leaders, volunteer for non-profits. Previously built an energy market prediction startup.

I write [essays](/posts/) on intelligence, entropy, and the philosophy of complex systems, along with shorter [writing](/writing/) about AI strategy and organizational intelligence.
