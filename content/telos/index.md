*Telos*: the end, purpose, or inherent aim of a thing.

## The unlock

Working with AI has unlocked what's inside my ADHD brain. Ideas used to stay trapped because the grind between conception and artifact was too long. Now they can exist in the world outside my head. This process gives me access to cognitive flow states and joy. When that friction drops, you actually get to experience your own cognition.

I want to help people feel that unlock, that expansion of aspiration and possibility. Not just from ADHD, but from any complexity or cognitive wall they feel constrained by. That's who this work is for.

## Mission

Build on-ramps that expand what people can aspire to and achieve in service of human flourishing.

## Beliefs

Entropy is the telos of the universe. Human thriving is intrinsically valuable. Human suffering is bad. Cooperation is the only way to achieve anything at scale, and Aumann's theorem tells us that honest information-sharing between agents converges on agreement as a natural equilibrium. The barriers to cooperation aren't fundamental. They're friction. We should be building coordination technologies that lower that friction.

## Models

Six models running at all times:

1. **Active Inference.** All persistent systems, from cells to companies, survive by maintaining a model of their world, acting on predictions, and updating when surprised. It works because this is already the pattern governing how adaptive systems behave.
2. **Entropy.** The telos that drives everything from the Big Bang to evolution to AI. Every complex structure that exists, including you, is a strategy for dissipating energy more efficiently.
3. **Variation.** Novelty arises at the edges of networks, not in the middle. Without variation, systems can't find more optimal solutions.
4. **Models and compression.** A generative model is an information compression of a functional system. Intelligence isn't about processing more data. It's about representing the right things and ruthlessly excluding the rest.
5. **Combination.** When different models make contact, they produce something neither could alone. The real work is reconciling their models of reality, not their data.
6. **Entropic Schelling points.** There's a reason so many models converge: OODA loops, Design Thinking, Active Inference, iterative hill-climbing. When you look for solutions, map the latent possibility space based on successful instantiations of isomorphic solutions.

## Why "syntropic"

Syntropy is the tendency of living systems to organize, to move toward greater complexity and coherence. Complex structures emerge because they dissipate energy more efficiently than the alternatives. Humans are each unique expressions of entropy trying to find its most efficient partner.

This site is where I think out loud about that process.
