*Telos*: the end, purpose, or inherent aim of a thing.

## The unlock

Working with AI has unlocked what's inside my ADHD brain. Ideas used to stay trapped because the grind between conception and artifact was too long. Now they can exist in the world outside my head. This process gives me access to cognitive flow states and joy.

I want to help people feel that unlock, that expansion of aspiration and possibility. Not just from ADHD, but from any complexity or cognitive wall they feel constrained by. That's who this work is for.

## Mission

Build on-ramps that expand what people can aspire to and achieve in service of human flourishing.

## Beliefs

Energy dissipates, and the interesting question is what gets built along the way. Life, culture, institutions, relationships are all temporary structures that exist because they dissipate energy more effectively than the alternatives. This is the most optimistic frame I know, because it means that what we build together emerges from physics, participating in the beauty and grandeur of what the universe is already doing.

Cooperation is how complex systems hold together long enough to matter. Coordinated action is thermodynamically cheaper than everyone grinding against each other in the dark, which is reason enough to take it seriously. And the fact that it can also be beautiful is a bonus the universe didn't owe us. The catch is that cooperation requires shared models as well as some mutual understanding of what's actually going on. Unfortunately, those models diverge constantly, silently, in ways that look more like personality conflicts or strategic disagreements. I think they're just people navigating different maps of the same territory.

Most of the friction I've seen in thirty years of working inside and alongside organizations comes from exactly this: misalignment that nobody can quite name. Entropy, cooperation, the quiet divergence of mental models. Everything else I do follows from there.

## Models

Six models running at all times:

1. **Active Inference.** All persistent systems, from cells to companies, survive by maintaining a model of their world, acting on predictions, and updating when surprised. It works because this is already the pattern governing how adaptive systems behave.
2. **Entropy.** The telos that drives everything from the Big Bang to evolution to AI. Every complex structure that exists, including you, is a strategy for dissipating energy more efficiently.
3. **Variation.** Novelty arises at the edges of networks, not in the middle. Without variation, systems can't find more optimal solutions.
4. **Models and compression.** A generative model is an information compression of a functional system. Intelligence isn't about processing more data. It's about representing the right things and ruthlessly excluding the rest.
5. **Combination.** When different models make contact, they produce something neither could alone. The real work is reconciling their models of reality, not their data.
6. **Entropic Schelling points.** OODA loops, Design Thinking, Active Inference, iterative hill-climbing – these aren't independent inventions. They converge because they're all approximating the same underlying structure. When multiple frameworks arrive at the same shape, that shape is worth trusting.

## Why "syntropic"

Syntropy is the tendency of living systems to organize, to move toward greater complexity and coherence. Complex structures emerge because they dissipate energy more efficiently than the alternatives. Humans are each unique expressions of entropy trying to find its most efficient partner.

This site is where I think out loud about that process.
