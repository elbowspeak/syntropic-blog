# Research Pulse — Week of 2026-02-16

*New papers and preprints in thermodynamics, active inference, bioelectricity, morphogenesis, and complexity.*

## Weekly Digest

This week shows significant theoretical development in Active Inference frameworks, with multiple papers refining the Expected Free Energy formulation and extending it to optimization and machine learning applications. A particularly intriguing paper proposes chemical oscillators demonstrating homeostasis emergence before genetic information through active inference—directly bridging to origins of life questions. The theoretical work on triple equivalence between classical and quantum perspectives on insight and creativity connects Active Inference to fundamental questions about novelty generation in cognitive systems.
