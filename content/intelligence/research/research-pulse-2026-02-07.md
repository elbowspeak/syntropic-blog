### Active Inference & Free Energy

**[Learning Query-Aware Budget-Tier Routing for Runtime Agent Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06025v1)**
*Haozhen Zhang, Haodong Yue et al.* — arXiv

> Memory is increasingly central to Large Language Model (LLM) agents operating beyond a single context window, yet most existing systems rely on offline, query-agnostic memory construction that can be inefficient and may discard query-critical information. Although runtime memory utilization is a nat...

**[Correctness-Optimized Residual Activation Lens (CORAL): Transferrable and Calibration-Aware Inference-Time Steering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06022v1)**
*Miranda Muqing Miao, Young-Min Cho et al.* — arXiv

> Large language models (LLMs) exhibit persistent miscalibration, especially after instruction tuning and preference alignment. Modified training objectives can improve calibration, but retraining is expensive. Inference-time steering offers a lightweight alternative, yet most existing methods optimiz...

**[Optimism Stabilizes Thompson Sampling for Adaptive Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06014v1)**
*Shunxing Yan, Han Zhong* — arXiv

> Thompson sampling (TS) is widely used for stochastic multi-armed bandits, yet its inferential properties under adaptive data collection are subtle. Classical asymptotic theory for sample means can fail because arm-specific sample sizes are random and coupled with the rewards through the action-selec...

### Thermodynamics & Dissipative Structures

**[Dissipative Dicke Time Quasicrystals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05994v1)**
*Sk Anisur, Sayan Choudhury* — arXiv

> We investigate the emergence of time quasicrystals (TQCs) in the open Dicke model, subjected to a quasi-periodic Fibonacci drive. TQCs are characterized by a robust sub-harmonic quasi-periodic response that is qualitatively distinct from the external drive. By directly analyzing the dynamics of the ...

**[AMDAT: An Open-Source Molecular Dynamics Analysis Toolkit for Supercooled Liquids, Glass-Forming Materials, and Complex Fluids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05865v1)**
*Pierre Kawak, William F. Drayer et al.* — arXiv

> AMDAT (Amorphous Molecular Dynamics Analysis Toolkit) is an open-source C++ toolkit for post-processing molecular dynamics trajectories, focused on high-performance static and dynamic analyses of amorphous, glassy, and polymer materials, including supercooled liquids and complex fluids. In this pape...

**[Quantum statistical functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05821v1)**
*Haruki Emori* — arXiv

> Statistical functions such as the moment-generating function, characteristic function, cumulant-generating function, and second characteristic function are cornerstone tools in classical statistics and probability theory. They provide a powerful means to analyze the statistical properties of a syste...

### Bioelectricity & Morphogenesis

**[BrainVista: Modeling Naturalistic Brain Dynamics as Multimodal Next-Token Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04512v1)**
*Xuanhua Yin, Runkai Zhao et al.* — arXiv

> Naturalistic fMRI characterizes the brain as a dynamic predictive engine driven by continuous sensory streams. However, modeling the causal forward evolution in realistic neural simulation is impeded by the timescale mismatch between multimodal inputs and the complex topology of cortical networks. T...

**[Multi-Integration of Labels across Categories for Component Identification (MILCCI)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04270v1)**
*Noga Mudrik, Yuxi Chen et al.* — arXiv

> Many fields collect large-scale temporal data through repeated measurements (trials), where each trial is labeled with a set of metadata variables spanning several categories. For example, a trial in a neuroscience study may be linked to a value from category (a): task difficulty, and category (b): ...

**[A computational account of dreaming: learning and memory consolidation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04095v1)**
*Qi Zhang* — arXiv

> A number of studies have concluded that dreaming is mostly caused by randomly arriving internal signals because "dream contents are random impulses", and argued that dream sleep is unlikely to play an important part in our intellectual capacity. On the contrary, numerous functional studies have reve...

### Natural Induction & Adaptive Systems

**[Intermittent precipitation and spatial Allee effects drive irregular vegetation patterns in semiarid ecosystems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05583v1)**
*Àlex Giménez-Romero, Bernard A. Afful et al.* — arXiv

> Vegetation in semi-arid ecosystems frequently organizes into spatially heterogeneous mosaics that regulate ecosystem functioning, productivity, and resilience. These patterns arise from local biological interactions, including facilitation among neighboring plants and competition for limiting resour...

**[Optimization is Not Enough: Why Problem Formulation Deserves Equal Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05466v1)**
*Iván Olarte Rodríguez, Gokhan Serhat et al.* — arXiv

> Black-box optimization is increasingly used in engineering design problems where simulation-based evaluations are costly and gradients are unavailable. In this context, the optimization community has largely analyzed algorithm performance in context-free setups, while not enough attention has been d...

**[Specieslike clusters based on identical ancestor points](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05274v1)**
*Samuel Allen Alexander* — arXiv

> We introduce several axioms which may or may not hold for any given subgraph of the directed graph of all organisms (past, present and future) where edges represent biological parenthood, with the simplifying background assumption that life does not go extinct. We argue these axioms are plausible fo...

### Complexity & Self-Organization

**[Dissipative Dicke Time Quasicrystals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05994v1)**
*Sk Anisur, Sayan Choudhury* — arXiv

> We investigate the emergence of time quasicrystals (TQCs) in the open Dicke model, subjected to a quasi-periodic Fibonacci drive. TQCs are characterized by a robust sub-harmonic quasi-periodic response that is qualitatively distinct from the external drive. By directly analyzing the dynamics of the ...

**[Spontaneous Parity Breaking in Quantum Antiferromagnets on the Triangular Lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05901v1)**
*Songtai Lv, Yuchen Meng et al.* — arXiv

> Frustration on the triangular lattice has long been a source of intriguing and often debated phases in many-body systems. Although symmetry analysis has been employed, the role of the seemingly trivial parity symmetry has received little attention. In this work, we show that phases induced by frustr...

**[Intermittent precipitation and spatial Allee effects drive irregular vegetation patterns in semiarid ecosystems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05583v1)**
*Àlex Giménez-Romero, Bernard A. Afful et al.* — arXiv

> Vegetation in semi-arid ecosystems frequently organizes into spatially heterogeneous mosaics that regulate ecosystem functioning, productivity, and resilience. These patterns arise from local biological interactions, including facilitation among neighboring plants and competition for limiting resour...

### Philosophy of Mind & Consciousness

**[A computational account of dreaming: learning and memory consolidation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04095v1)**
*Qi Zhang* — arXiv

> A number of studies have concluded that dreaming is mostly caused by randomly arriving internal signals because "dream contents are random impulses", and argued that dream sleep is unlikely to play an important part in our intellectual capacity.

**[Adversarial construction as a potential solution to the experiment design problem in large task spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03172v1)**
*Prakhar Godara, Frederick Callaway et al.* — arXiv

> Despite decades of work, we still lack a robust, task-general theory of human behavior even in the simplest domains. In this paper we tackle the generality problem head-on, by aiming to develop a unified model for all tasks embedded in a task-space. In particular we consider the space of binary sequ...

**[Inter- and Intra-Subject Variability in EEG: A Systematic Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01019v1)**
*Xuan-The Tran, Thien-Nhan Vo et al.* — arXiv

> Electroencephalography (EEG) underpins neuroscience, clinical neurophysiology, and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), yet pronounced inter- and intra-subject variability limits reliability, reproducibility, and translation. This systematic review studies that quantified or modeled EEG variability acr...
