## Signals

### Compute | Applied Materials unveils 2nm chip manufacturing systems
- What: 
Applied Materials introduced new deposition, etch and materials modification systems that boost the performance of leading-edge logic chips at 2nm and beyond

- Impact: Accelerates Gate-All-Around transistor production for next-gen AI chips; enables faster fab transitions to angstrom-era nodes
- Confidence: High
- Source: Applied Materials press release (Feb 10, 2026)

### Compute | AWS signs multi-billion dollar chip deal with STMicroelectronics  
- What: 
Amazon Web Services entered into a major multiyear agreement with STMicroelectronics, committing to purchase several billion dollars' worth of semiconductor chips and related services, positioning STMicroelectronics as a key supplier supporting Amazon's fast-expanding AI and cloud infrastructure

- Impact: Secures critical chip supply for AWS datacenter buildout; signals hyperscalers vertically integrating supply chains with equity-linked deals
- Confidence: High
- Source: Engineers Outlook (Feb 10, 2026)

### Compute | SMIC warns of AI chip overcapacity risk
- What: 
China's top chipmaker warned that breakaway spending on artificial intelligence chips is bringing forward years of future demand, with SMIC cochief executive saying "Companies would love to build 10 years' worth of data center capacity within one or two years"

- Impact: First major signal from supply side that AI infrastructure buildout may be pulling forward demand unsustainably; idle capacity risk could affect pricing and capex decisions
- Confidence: Medium-High
- Source: Taipei Times (Feb 12, 2026)

### Compute | Memory revenue to outpace foundries 2.5x in AI boom
- What: 
TrendForce projects global foundry revenue at $218.7 billion while 3D NAND and DRAM revenue will reach $551.6 billion, meaning total memory market is more than twice as large as contract chip production

- Impact: Reveals critical supply chain bottleneck; memory makers capturing disproportionate AI value; validates HBM shortage as multi-year constraint
- Confidence: High

### Models | OpenAI releases GPT-5.2 with professional knowledge work focus
- What: 
OpenAI introduced GPT-5.2, described as "the most capable model series yet for professional knowledge work," setting "a new state of the art across many benchmarks, including GDPval, where it outperforms industry professionals at well-specified knowledge work tasks spanning 44 occupations"

- Impact: Signals continued inference compute demand growth; pushes enterprise adoption boundaries
- Confidence: High
- Source: OpenAI (Recent, exact date unclear from search)

### Models | NVIDIA releases Nemotron 3 family and physical AI models
- What: 
NVIDIA announced the NVIDIA Nemotron 3 family of open models, data and libraries designed to power transparent, efficient and specialized agentic AI development across industries

- Impact: Major shift toward open-source agentic AI infrastructure; early adopters include Accenture, ServiceNow, Oracle; diversifies inference workload patterns
- Confidence: High
- Source: NVIDIA press release (Recent)

### Second-order | Goldman warns AI driving electricity price inflation
- What: 
Goldman analysts report rapid growth of data centers is colliding with constrained electricity supply as regulatory barriers and labor/material shortages hinder new power plant construction, with tight supply-demand balance pushing up wholesale electricity prices, particularly in California, Midwest and mid-Atlantic

- Impact: Energy now recognized supply chain bottleneck equal to chips; becoming "major political flashpoint ahead of midterm elections"; could constrain deployment velocity
- Confidence: High
- Source: CNBC (Feb 13, 2026)

### Second-order | Bipartisan political backlash against datacenter energy costs
- What: 
Virginia's utility regulator is requiring data centers to pay majority of costs for new transmission/generation serving them beginning 2027, while Bernie Sanders and Ron DeSantis have emerged as leading skeptics of AI datacenter boom

- Impact: First major regulatory shift forcing cost internalization; signals potential nationwide wave of similar measures; deployment friction increasing
- Confidence: High
- Source: CNBC (Jan 1, 2026) / Multiple outlets

### Second-order | PJM grid operator facing 6GW shortfall by 2027
- What: 
PJM Interconnection, the largest US grid operator serving over 65 million people across 13 states, projects it will be a full six gigawatts short of its reliability requirements in 2027

- Impact: Hard infrastructure constraint on datacenter deployments in largest US market; forces behind-the-meter or co-location strategies
- Confidence: High  
- Source: Common Dreams via CNBC (Jan 3, 2026)

## Causal Updates

**Energy has emerged as the binding constraint on AI supply chain**, displacing chip availability concerns. The convergence of:
- Grid capacity shortfalls (PJM -6GW by 2027)
- Political backlash becoming bipartisan (Sanders-DeSantis alignment unprecedented)
- Regulatory response shifting costs to datacenters (Virginia 2027 rules)
- Goldman identifying this as macro inflation driver

Creates a **new three-way constraint model**: Chips → Memory → Energy, with energy now the tightest bottleneck.

**Memory value capture exceeds compute manufacturing** - TrendForce showing 2.5x revenue advantage for memory vs foundries reveals HBM/DRAM suppliers have superior pricing power in current cycle. This inverts traditional semiconductor value distribution.

**Chinese supply chain exhibiting first demand-pull concerns** - SMIC's unprecedented warning about "10 years in 2 years" buildout suggests overcapacity risk materializing faster in isolated Chinese ecosystem, potentially leading indicator for global market.

## Predictions

**H1 2026**: Expect wave of datacenter-specific energy regulations across 5-10 additional US states following Virginia model. Probability: 70%

**2026-2027**: Co-location and behind-the-meter generation becomes dominant deployment model, driving mini-nuclear/gas turbine equipment suppliers. Already signaled by Virginia regulation forcing this shift. Probability: 65%

**2027**: Memory supply bottleneck persists despite capacity additions; HBM pricing remains elevated 40%+ above historical norms. TrendForce data + fab buildout timelines support this. Probability: 60%

**2026**: First major AI infrastructure project cancellations or deferrals due to grid connection delays, not chip shortages. PJM shortfall + regulatory friction suggest this. Probability: 55%

**Uncertainty**: Whether SMIC warning is China-specific isolation effect or leading indicator of global overcapacity. Need 2-3 months more data.
