### 🔴 Startups & Products | VERSES AI CEO Exits; Interim Leadership Takes Over Amid Going-Concern Warning

- **What:** 
On February 8, 2026, Gabriel René resigned as Chief Executive Officer and director of VERSES AI; David Scott, a current board member, was appointed as interim CEO while a search for a permanent replacement is conducted.

- **Why it matters:** This is the most consequential leadership event in Active Inference commercialization this week. René was the public face and narrative architect of the company's FEP-grounded vision. Simultaneously, 
VERSES AI reported a quarterly loss with only ~$68K in cash and a $13.2M shareholders' deficit, with management warning of substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.
 Combined, these signals indicate VERSES is in a genuine survival crisis — not a pivot.

### 🔴 Startups & Products | VERSES Files 10-Q, Holds Investor Webinar; Revenue Remains Minimal

- **What:** 
VERSES AI filed its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2025, with the SEC, and held an earnings call on February 24, 2026.
 
Revenue came in at $0.82M, with a gross profit of $0.13M, but operating loss was $(24.90)M and net loss was $(24.98)M for the period.

- **Why it matters:** Revenue remains negligible relative to burn. 
VERSES also filed an 8-K furnishing the transcript and presentation from its February 18, 2026 management webinar, in which leadership discussed recent management changes and the company's current state.
 The investor communication blitz signals awareness that market confidence is eroding.

### 🟡 Startups & Products | VERSES Restructures Operations, Cuts ~50% of Workforce

- **What:** 
VERSES announced a strategic refocus on core target markets on January 16, 2026, implementing a workforce restructuring that reduced headcount by approximately 50%, terminated certain previously furloughed employees and some executives, and had certain executives temporarily defer salaries — moves management said are intended to drastically reduce operating costs and improve liquidity.

- **Why it matters:** The layoffs confirm the company is in contraction, not expansion. This is the active inference field's highest-profile commercial bet, and its difficulties will likely dampen near-term investor appetite for pure-play FEP startups.
- **Confidence:** High

### 🟡 Enterprise Adoption | VERSES Expands Contract with Major Investment Firm for Active Inference Financial Model

- **What:** 
VERSES expanded its commercial relationship with a major global investment firm (unnamed), extending their consulting arrangement with additional milestone-based payments; the company will use its Genius™ platform to develop an active inference causal model for financial markets to enhance asset allocation decisions, with the project focusing on improving drawdown and volatility metrics, and the expanded contract including fixed milestone-based payments initially with provisions for outcome-based pricing in the future.

- **Why it matters:** This is the most concrete active-inference-in-production signal this week. A milestone-based, outcome-linked contract structure in quantitative finance is exactly the kind of enterprise deployment the field needs as proof-of-concept. However, the client remains unnamed and revenue materiality is unclear given VERSES's financial position.
- **Confidence:** Medium (client unconfirmed; contract value not disclosed)

### 🟡 Startups & Products | VERSES Granted US Patent for Natural-Language Specification of Active Inference Agents

- **What:** 
VERSES AI was granted a significant patent (US 12,393,581 B2) by the US Patent and Trademark Office for their innovative method of specifying active inference-based agents using natural language, outlining a novel approach for designing domain models that enable software agents to generate predictions and perform domain-specific tasks.

- **Why it matters:** 
CTO Hari Thiruvengada stated: "By allowing domain models to be expressed in natural language, we're enabling enterprises to design intelligent agents that are both powerful and accessible."
 This IP positions VERSES for licensing revenue even in a survival scenario and raises the IP moat around natural-language-to-active-inference-agent pipelines.
- **Confidence:** High (USPTO grant is verifiable)

### 🟢 Ecosystem | IWAI 2026 Announced — Hosted in Madrid, October 14–16

- **What:** 
The 7th International Conference on Active Inference (IWAI 2026) has been announced as an interdisciplinary venue to discuss current trends, novel results, and real-world applications of active inference; the theme will be "foundations," with a dedicated stream on Empirical, Clinical, and Real-World Applications covering robotics, IoT, clinical, industrial, and societal challenges.
 
The submission deadline is June 7, 2026, with the workshop scheduled for October 14–16, 2026
, hosted at the Spanish National Research Council.
- **Why it matters:** 
IWAI 2026 is actively welcoming sponsorship from industry partners seeking to draw real-world applications from an emerging foundational theory of human cognition.
 The explicit industry-track and sponsorship solicitation signals the community's deliberate push toward commercialization. IWAI is the primary conference pipeline for pre-commercial active inference research.

### 🟢 Academic-to-Commercial Pipeline | pymdp JAX Migration Underway for v1.0 Release

- **What:** 
The pymdp team is currently migrating pymdp to a JAX backend as part of their roadmap for a v1 release of the package; the v1.0.0_alpha branch is the current best balance of new features and stability, with plans to merge these features into the master branch as soon as possible.

- **Why it matters:** 
pymdp is a Python package for simulating active inference agents in Markov Decision Process environments, hosted on the infer-actively GitHub organization, built with the intention of hosting open-source active inference and free-energy-principle related software.
 The JAX migration is a significant architectural step — JAX enables GPU/TPU acceleration and JIT compilation, dramatically lowering the barrier for engineers to run production-scale active inference. This is the primary open-source on-ramp for enterprise developers.
- **Confidence:** High (GitHub-confirmed roadmap)

### 🟢 Academic-to-Commercial Pipeline | ActiveInference.jl Extends Ecosystem into Julia for Engineering Contexts

- **What:** 
The Julia-based factor graph library RxInfer has been used to implement active inference models on an efficient factor graph back-end, and these tools make active inference available for researchers to perform simulation studies and for use in engineering contexts — though they do not yet generally allow for fitting models to empirically observed data.

- **Why it matters:** 
The Active Inference Institute has hosted livestreams on "the future of ActiveInference.jl: designing for modularity, flexibility, ease-of-use, and breadth of application when making tools for active inference modelling."
 The Julia ecosystem (via RxInfer.jl and ActiveInference.jl) is emerging as the performance-oriented complement to pymdp, and is particularly relevant for real-time robotics and control applications.
- **Confidence:** Medium (no major new release this specific week, but active development confirmed)

## 📊 Market Trajectory

The week ending February 25, 2026 represents a **significant inflection point — and sobering reality check — for Active Inference commercialization.**

VERSES AI, the field's most visible commercial bet and effectively the de facto flagship of FEP-in-production, is in acute distress. The departure of founder Gabriel René, a going-concern warning with only ~$68K in cash on hand, a ~50% workforce reduction, and a net loss of ~$24.98M against $0.82M in revenue paints a stark picture. The gap between the theoretical promise of Active Inference and the commercial execution required to sustain a public company in the current AI market has proven difficult to bridge at VERSES's pace. The expanded financial markets contract is a bright spot, but it is milestone-based and too small to resolve the structural problem.

The broader ecosystem, however, is showing signs of maturation independent of VERSES: IWAI 2026 is actively courting industry sponsors, the Active Inference Institute is re-governing itself for scale, pymdp is heading toward a JAX-accelerated v1, and the Julia/RxInfer engineering stack is gaining traction in applied domains. The field's open-source and academic infrastructure is arguably stronger than its commercial layer right now — which is common at this stage of a paradigm transition.

**Headwinds:** VERSES's distress could trigger a credibility penalty for the entire framework in the eyes of enterprise buyers and investors who conflate the company with the theory. The mainstream "AI inference" investment wave (LLM serving, chips, infrastructure) is absorbing enormous capital but is definitionally unrelated to Active Inference/FEP — creating confusion in investor communication.

**Tailwinds:** The patent grant for natural-language agent specification, the financial markets causal modeling contract, and the robustness of the open-source toolchain represent genuine progress. The framework's core value proposition — causal, adaptive, explainable AI without massive retraining — has become *more* differentiated as LLM limitations become apparent to enterprises.

## 🔮 Predictions

1. **VERSES will not survive in its current form past H1 2026 without a major capital injection or acquisition.** Given the going-concern disclosure, ~$68K cash, and ongoing operating losses exceeding $24M annualized, the company needs either a strategic acquirer (perhaps a defense contractor, a quantitative finance firm, or a large enterprise software player) or a capital event within 60–90 days. The financial markets contract and the US patent may be the most attractive M&A assets.

2. **The Active Inference commercialization center of gravity will shift from VERSES toward the open-source ecosystem and academic spinouts over the next 12–18 months.** pymdp v1 (JAX-backed) and RxInfer.jl will become the default developer on-ramps, enabling smaller, domain-specific companies to build on the framework without depending on VERSES. Expect niche active inference applications to emerge first in robotics control, computational psychiatry tooling, and quantitative finance.

3. **IWAI 2026's industry-track and sponsorship model will surface 2–4 new commercially-oriented research groups** that will be worth tracking as early-stage commercial signals by Q4 2026.

4. **The "Active Inference for financial markets" application class will accelerate** regardless of VERSES's fate. The causal modeling and uncertainty quantification properties of FEP-derived agents are genuinely differentiated from LLMs for asset allocation and risk management — and that use case is now publicly documented via the VERSES contract.
