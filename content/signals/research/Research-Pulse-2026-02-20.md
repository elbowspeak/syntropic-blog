# Research Pulse — Week of 2026-02-20

*New papers and preprints in thermodynamics, active inference, bioelectricity, morphogenesis, and complexity.*

## Weekly Digest

This week features significant work bridging active inference with practical applications: a novel framework connecting predictive processing to transformer architectures, and empirical validation of active inference in autonomous vehicle control. The theoretical foundations are strengthened by new work on Bayesian mechanics and the free energy principle's relationship to self-organization. Notable biological contributions include advances in understanding morphogenetic fields through bioelectric signaling and new perspectives on convergent evolution in complex traits.
