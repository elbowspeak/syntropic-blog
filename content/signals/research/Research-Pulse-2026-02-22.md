# Research Pulse — Week of 2026-02-22

*New papers and preprints in thermodynamics, active inference, bioelectricity, morphogenesis, and complexity.*

## Weekly Digest

This week's most compelling find is the BEDS framework, which directly bridges Bayesian inference, dissipative structures, and energy-constrained cognition — a rare synthesis that will resonate strongly with interests spanning Free Energy Principle, Prigogine-style thermodynamics, and biological intelligence. The "Entropy Bathtub" paper offers a Markovian formalism for living systems as dissipative, self-organizing entities far from equilibrium, which connects meaningfully to both thermodynamic foundations and questions about biological order. Beyond these two, the remaining papers this week fall into astrophysics, quantum field theory, or cloud computing applications of thermodynamic metaphors — interesting domains in their own right, but too far removed from the core research agenda to warrant inclusion.

## Papers by Topic

### Thermodynamics & Dissipative Structures

**[BEDS: Bayesian Emergent Dissipative Structures: A Formal Framework for Continuous Inference Under Energy Constraints](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6cddbe4bd574984b1583f9d3e8cee8b2dfe5f4da)**
*Laurent Caraffa* — Semantic Scholar

> Formalizes inference systems that maintain beliefs continuously under energy constraints, directly linking Bayesian inference with dissipative structure theory.

**[Entropy Bathtub for Living Systems: A Markovian Perspective](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/36fcb43abf09e01af5b479f4bf93aa7b6e65a6a9)**
*K. W. Fornalski* — Semantic Scholar

> Models living organisms as driven Markov jump processes far from equilibrium, formalizing self-organization and entropy dynamics in biological dissipative systems.
