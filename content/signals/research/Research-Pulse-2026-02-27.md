*Souhir Ezzedini* — Semantic Scholar

> Cognitive fatigue is typically described as a psychobiological state that arises from intensive and/or prolonged cognitive performance and is experienced as a subjective feeling of exhaustion and lack...

**[Unexpected Applications of the Free Energy Principle and Surrealism for Art Therapy](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a89550019a4e30701295a2f4f48eb932cff1352b)**
*Z. Djebbara, Robin Mazumder, Juliet King* — Semantic Scholar

**[Variational free energy as a conceptual framework for understanding habituation in spinal cord stimulation](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/477bd2f2a37f8b6f2c823c3e80de68c1033f8922)**
*Alexander Taghva* — Semantic Scholar

>     Habituation, or loss of clinical benefit over time, is a frequent problem in spinal cord stimulation (SCS). Existing programming strategies such as waveform cycling or closed-loop stimulation try ...

**[Pragmatic Curiosity: A Hybrid Learning-Optimization Paradigm via Active Inference](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/05bf9770fea1381c218179d26f156cd00ad9b000)**
*Yingke Li, Anjali Parashar, Enlu Zhou et al.* — Semantic Scholar

> Many engineering and scientific workflows depend on expensive black-box evaluations, requiring decision-making that simultaneously improves performance and reduces uncertainty. Bayesian optimization (...

**[Curiosity is Knowledge: Self-Consistent Learning and No-Regret Optimization with Active Inference](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/26e7542bf27ae66f96c0f043d7f61523f7585b05)**
*Yingke Li, Anjali Parashar, Enlu Zhou et al.* — Semantic Scholar

> Active inference (AIF) unifies exploration and exploitation by minimizing the Expected Free Energy (EFE), balancing epistemic value (information gain) and pragmatic value (task performance) through a ...

**[Active Inference Modeling of Socially Shared Cognition in Virtual Reality](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cf94d7f461faf5d0ccb6e9622ec6a8b6fd5140a0)**
*Yoshiko Arima, Mahiro Okada* — Semantic Scholar

> This study proposes a process model for sharing ambiguous category concepts in virtual reality (VR) using an active inference framework. The model executes a dual-layer Bayesian update after observing...

**[BRAIN: Bayesian Reasoning via Active Inference for Agentic and Embodied Intelligence in Mobile Networks](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c072cd247c21cb4e1ee483e351ab4d5cca68700d)**
*Osman Tugay Basaran, Martin Maier, Falko Dressler* — Semantic Scholar

**[QoE-Guaranteed Optimization in MEC-Enabled Metaverse: An Active Inference Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a7895a6d6709d73b9cee5c223b792339d659ea4e)**
*Jianbo Du, Jie Gong, Xiaoli Chu et al.* — Semantic Scholar

> In this paper, we consider a MEC-enabled metaverse scenario which consists of a remote metaverse server and an edge server that cooperates to provide services to mobile users. The edge server is deplo...

**[Don't Break the Boundary: Continual Unlearning for OOD Detection Based on Free Energy Repulsion](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dd53a5f80fae37fa0d58fa081d9745986b66ae84)**
*Ningkang Peng, Kun Shao, Jingyang Mao et al.* — Semantic Scholar

> Deploying trustworthy AI in open-world environments faces a dual challenge: the necessity for robust Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection to ensure system safety, and the demand for flexible machine un...
