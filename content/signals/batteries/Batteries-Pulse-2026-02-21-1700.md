### Virtual Power Plants | North American Capacity Reaches 37.5 GW
- **What**: 
North American capacity reached 37.5 GW in 2025
, though 
capacity grew by a more modest 13.7%
 compared to 33%+ growth in new VPP programs and deployments.
- **Why it matters**: VPPs are scaling but face regulatory friction. The gap between program announcements and actual enrolled capacity signals implementation barriers (enrollment caps, data-sharing restrictions, utility incentive misalignment). The DOE target of 80-160 GW by 2030 looks increasingly ambitious.
- **Confidence**: High
