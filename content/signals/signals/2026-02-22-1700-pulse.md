## Signals

### 1. Compute | India Semiconductor Fab Foundation Stone Ceremony Today (Feb 23)
- **What**: 
India's MeitY secretary announced deployment of semiconductor chips made in India during 2026, with foundation stone ceremony for Rs 3,700-crore Foxconn-HCL semiconductor unit expected on February 23

- **Impact**: Reduces India's 90% import dependence on chips, diversifies global supply chain away from China (which supplies 60%+ of India's current chips); signals geopolitical hedging in fab capacity
- **Confidence**: High
- **Source**: The Federal (Feb 21, 2026)

### 2. Compute | Memory Price Explosion - DRAM Up 90-95% QoQ in Q1 2026
- **What**: 
TrendForce revised Q1 2026 conventional DRAM contract price increases from 55-60% to 90-95% QoQ, with NAND Flash rising from 33-38% to 55-60%

- **Impact**: Structural supply crisis driven by AI data center HBM demand cannibalizing consumer/enterprise capacity; enterprise SSD prices up 53-58% QoQ; affects entire computing stack from PCs to smartphones to data centers
- **Confidence**: High
- **Source**: TrendForce (Feb 2, 2026), IDC analysis, multiple industry sources

### 3. Compute | Memory Shortage Termed "Permanent Strategic Reallocation"
- **What**: 
IDC describes this as "not just a cyclical shortage" but a "permanent, strategic reallocation" where Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron pivot to HBM for hyperscalers; "every wafer allocated to an HBM stack for an Nvidia GPU is a wafer denied" to consumer devices

- **Impact**: Zero-sum game in silicon wafer capacity; consumer electronics (smartphones, PCs) become "price takers" vs. AI infrastructure as "price makers"; structural 2-3 year shortage through 2027
- **Confidence**: High
- **Source**: IDC (Feb 2026), Wikipedia entry on 2024-present memory shortage

### 4. Compute | Western Digital HDD Supply for 2026 Already Sold Out
- **What**: 
Western Digital's hard disk supply for 2026 was booked for enterprise applications before February 2026

- **Impact**: AI data centers driving unprecedented storage demand beyond just SSDs; alternative storage tier (HDDs) also constrained, forcing enterprises into higher-cost SSD-only architectures
- **Confidence**: Medium
- **Source**: Wikipedia citing industry reports (Feb 2026)

### 5. Second-order | Glass Cloth Supply Crisis for High-End Chips
- **What**: 
Glass cloth, a crucial high-performance substrate for power-efficient high-speed data transfer, is experiencing supply crisis as monopoly supplier Nitto Boseki cannot meet demand, forcing Qualcomm, Apple, Nvidia and AMD to compete for supply

- **Impact**: Hidden bottleneck in advanced packaging; constrains ability to scale cutting-edge AI chip production even if fab capacity exists; demonstrates supply chain brittleness beyond obvious components
- **Confidence**: Medium
- **Source**: Wikipedia citing industry sources (2026)

### 6. Deployment | Inference Spending Crosses 55% of AI Cloud Infrastructure 
- **What**: 
Inference spending crossed 55% of AI cloud infrastructure ($37.5B) in early 2026, surpassing training for the first time; accounts for 80-90% of total compute costs over a model's lifecycle

- **Impact**: Fundamental shift in where capex flows; validates inference-optimized chip strategies (Groq acquisition by NVIDIA for $20B); different optimization targets than training GPUs
- **Confidence**: High
- **Source**: byteiota analysis (Jan 2026)

### 7. Deployment | Hyperscaler Capex Hits $600B in 2026, 75% AI-Related
- **What**: 
Hyperscaler capital expenditure hit $600 billion in 2026 (36% increase over 2025), with 75% ($450 billion) tied directly to AI infrastructure

- **Impact**: Unprecedented capital deployment sustaining multi-year equipment/chip demand; not a temporary spike but sustained build-out cycle
- **Confidence**: High
- **Source**: byteiota citing McKinsey (Jan 2026)

### 8. Compute | SMIC Warns of Rushed AI Capacity Could End Up Idle
- **What**: 
SMIC co-CEO stated "Companies would love to build 10 years' worth of data center capacity within one or two years" but "what exactly these data centers will do, that hasn't been fully thought through"; Moody's projects AI infrastructure investment exceeding $3 trillion over next five years

- **Impact**: First major warning of potential AI infrastructure overcapacity from leading foundry; suggests market may be overbuilding relative to actual workload demand; risk of stranded assets
- **Confidence**: Medium
- **Source**: Taipei Times (Feb 12, 2026)

## Causal Updates

**New Cause-Effect Relationship: AI Inference Dominance → Memory Architecture Shift**
- The crossing of inference above training spending (55%+ of AI cloud spend) is driving a distinct set of hardware requirements: memory bandwidth over raw compute, lower latency over throughput, edge deployment over centralized. This explains NVIDIA's $20B Groq acquisition and AMD's focus on memory-heavy MI300X variants.

**Reinforced: HBM Demand → Consumer Electronics Cannibalization**
- The "permanent strategic reallocation" thesis is now consensus among analysts (IDC, TrendForce). This isn't a 2-quarter tight supply - it's a 2-3 year structural shift where memory makers have explicitly chosen to exit/deprioritize consumer markets for AI margins (70%+ for HBM vs commodity DRAM).

**New Risk: Supply Chain Brittleness in Obscure Components**
- The glass cloth shortage (Nitto Boseki monopoly) reveals that even if leading-edge fabs scale, bottlenecks can emerge in seemingly mundane materials. Advanced packaging requires dozens of specialized materials with limited suppliers - each is a potential chokepoint.

**Emerging: Data Center Overcapacity Risk**
- SMIC's warning about building "10 years of capacity in 2 years" without clear use cases represents the first major industry voice questioning the sustainability of current AI infrastructure spending. This contrasts sharply with the bullish hyperscaler capex data.

## Predictions

**High Confidence (70%+):**
- Memory prices will remain elevated through H1 2027, with consumer PC/smartphone markets seeing ASP increases of 3-8% and potential unit volume declines of 3-5%
- At least one major OEM will delay or cancel product launches in 2026 due to inability to secure memory at viable economics
- Inference chip market will exceed $75B by end 2026 (already at $50B+ vs original $25B 2027 projection)

**Medium Confidence (50-70%):**
- India will successfully produce first commercial semiconductor output in H2 2026, marking credible "third pole" in fab geopolitics alongside Taiwan/US and China
- Secondary memory/storage bottlenecks (glass cloth, photoresists, advanced packaging materials) will become headline news as primary chip capacity scales
- At least one hyperscaler will announce a pause or reduction in data center expansion citing demand uncertainty (echoing SMIC's warning)

**Speculative (<50%):**
- Memory shortage triggers consolidation in consumer electronics - smaller smartphone OEMs exit unable to compete for supply allocations
- Secondary market for used enterprise hardware (decommissioned servers with DDR4/5 RAM) experiences 50%+ price appreciation as "dark inventory" gets liquidated to hungry buyers

## Investment Implications

**Increasingly Attractive:**

1. **Memory Manufacturers (Samsung, SK Hynix, Micron)** - Operating in a seller's market with unprecedented pricing power. HBM gross
