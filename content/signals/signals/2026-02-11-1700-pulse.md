### Compute | 3D Chip Breakthrough Demonstrates 10x AI Performance Gains
- What: 
Stanford/CMU/Penn/MIT team with SkyWater foundry produced first monolithic 3D AI chip in US commercial fab, achieving order-of-magnitude performance improvements over 2D chips

- Impact: Breaks memory-compute bottleneck for AI hardware; demonstrates domestic production viability at scale; potential 12x improvement on AI workloads at higher densities
- Confidence: High

### Compute | China's SMIC Warns of Massive AI Datacenter Overcapacity Risk  
- What: 
SMIC co-CEO stated companies want to build 10 years' worth of datacenter capacity in 1-2 years, with concerns that "what exactly these data centers will do, that hasn't been fully thought through"

- Impact: First major fab signaling demand-pull forward risk; validates concerns about $3T+ AI infrastructure spending creating stranded assets; HBM shortage persisting
- Confidence: High
- Source: Taipei Times, Bloomberg (9-19 hours ago)

### Deployment | Cloudera Launches On-Prem AI Inference with NVIDIA Blackwell
- What: 
Cloudera AI Inference now available on-premises with NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, Dynamo-Triton, and NIM microservices for enterprise-scale deployment

- Impact: Major shift toward on-prem inference to avoid cloud cost volatility; enterprise preference for predictable economics over variable cloud pricing emerging
- Confidence: High  
- Source: GlobeNewswire (2 days ago)

### Second-order | Bipartisan Political Opposition to Data Centers Crystallizing
- What: 
Bernie Sanders and Ron DeSantis align as leading skeptics of AI datacenter boom, signaling "political reckoning brewing over AI industry's impact on electricity prices, grid stability and labor market"

- Impact: Electoral risk for 2026 midterms; potential construction moratoria; 
residential electricity prices forecast to rise 4% in 2026 after 5% in 2025

- Confidence: High

### Second-order | FERC Mandated to Expedite Large Load Grid Connections by April 2026
- What: 
DOE Secretary directed FERC to finalize rules by April 30, 2026 extending federal role in connecting 20+ MW loads to transmission grids, facing 200+ diverging comments from states/utilities worried about cost and reliability

- Impact: Major federal-state jurisdictional battle; utilities want 100-MW threshold vs hyperscaler speed demands; litigation expected
- Confidence: Medium

## Causal Updates

**Inference Economics Driving Architectural Shift**: 
Inference spending crossed 55% of AI cloud infrastructure ($37.5B) in early 2026, surpassing training for the first time
. This is causing enterprises to move toward on-premises deployment for predictable costs, as evidenced by Cloudera's launch. The causal chain: inference dominates lifecycle costs → cloud volatility becomes untenable → enterprises repatriate workloads.

**Demand Pull-Forward Creating Supply-Demand Mismatch**: SMIC's warning reveals that 
Moody's projects AI infrastructure investment to exceed $3 trillion over next five years
, but this represents accelerated deployment of future capacity without clear utilization plans. Simultaneously, 
HBM shortage could persist for years as new capacity takes time to build and qualify
. This creates a scissors crisis: overbuilt datacenter shells with insufficient specialized components.

**Political Economy of Power Becoming Binding Constraint**: 
AI workloads scale faster than US power grid designed to handle, with 70% of grid approaching end of lifecycle
. The political backlash from Sanders/DeSantis suggests power availability—not chip supply—may become the actual bottleneck by late 2026.

## Predictions

**Q2-Q3 2026: On-Prem Inference Accelerates** (Medium confidence): With inference economics favoring on-premises and Cloudera/NVIDIA providing enterprise-ready stack, expect 20-30% of Fortune 500 to announce hybrid inference strategies by mid-year. Cloud providers will respond with reserved capacity pricing or PTU-like models.

**H2 2026: First Major Datacenter Stranded Asset** (Low-Medium confidence): SMIC's warning combined with economic uncertainty suggests at least one hyperscaler or sovereign AI project will announce delayed activation or mothballing of datacenter capacity due to demand softness or power constraints.

**2026-2027: HBM Becomes De Facto Allocation Mechanism** (High confidence): With 
HBM shortage persisting
 while datacenter capacity expands, memory allocation rather than compute capacity will determine who can deploy frontier models. Secondary market for HBM modules likely emerges.

**Pre-November 2026: Datacenter Construction Moratorium Proposed** (Medium confidence): Given bipartisan opposition and midterm electoral incentives, expect at least 3-5 states to propose construction limits or mandatory cost-shifting requirements before elections. Federal preemption attempts will trigger litigation.
