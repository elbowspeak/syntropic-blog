## Signals (if any meaningful ones exist)

### Compute | Applied Materials announces 2nm transistor manufacturing systems
- What: 
Applied Materials introduced new deposition, etch and materials modification systems that boost the performance of leading-edge logic chips at 2nm and beyond
, including 
molybdenum contact system reducing resistance by 15 percent

- Impact: Directly enables next-gen AI chip production capacity; affects foundry roadmaps for TSMC, Samsung; reduces bottlenecks in GAA transistor manufacturing for AI accelerators
- Confidence: High
- Source: Applied Materials press release (Feb 10, 2026)

### Compute | SMIC warns of AI chip capacity glut risk
- What: 
China's top chipmaker warned that breakaway spending on AI chips is bringing forward years of future demand, with companies wanting to build 10 years' worth of data center capacity within one or two years

- Impact: First major signal of potential AI infrastructure oversupply; could indicate demand-pull forward creating future idle capacity; affects capex cycles and HBM supply dynamics
- Confidence: Medium-High
- Source: SMIC earnings call (Feb 12, 2026)

### Compute | Memory shortage extended through 2027
- What: 
Synopsys CEO stated the chip "crunch" will continue through 2026 and 2027
, with 
HBM shortage persisting for years as new capacity takes time to build

- Impact: Constrains AI accelerator production despite fab capacity; affects inference deployment timelines; creates sustained pricing power for memory suppliers (SK Hynix, Micron, Samsung)
- Confidence: High
- Source: CNBC interview with Synopsys CEO (Jan 26, 2026)

### Deployment | Inference costs drop 50% in last year
- What: 
AI Inference Costs Drop 50%, materially changing pricing, routing, and scale strategy
, with 
LLM inference prices falling 50x per year median, accelerating to 200x per year after January 2024

- Impact: Enables new AI application economics; allows free-tier expansion; but 
40% per-request cost drop triggered 3× increase in daily requests, with total spending increasing despite cheaper tokens
 (demand elasticity effect)
- Confidence: High
- Source: Multiple industry analyses (Feb 14-15, 2026)

### Deployment | Inference spending crosses 55% of AI cloud spend
- What: 
Inference spending crossed 55% of AI cloud infrastructure ($37.5B) in early 2026, surpassing training for the first time
, with 
McKinsey projecting inference to represent 70-80% of AI compute by 2027

- Impact: Fundamental shift in AI supply chain economics from training-centric to inference-centric; changes chip architecture priorities, data center designs, and vendor strategies
- Confidence: High
- Source: Industry analysis (Jan 2026)

### Second-order | Energy crisis hits political flashpoint ahead of midterms
- What: 
Residential electricity prices forecast to rise 4% in 2026 after 5% in 2025, with data center impact on local communities likely playing a role in mid-term elections
; 
Sanders called for national moratorium on data center construction

- Impact: Threatens AI data center buildout velocity; could trigger permitting slowdowns, BYOG mandates, or capacity constraints independent of chip supply; political risk now material to AI supply chain
- Confidence: High  
- Source: CNBC (Jan 1, 2026), EIA forecasts

### Second-order | PJM grid faces 6 GW reliability shortfall by 2027
- What: 
PJM Interconnection projects it will be 6 gigawatts short of reliability requirements in 2027
, with 
shortage most acute on nation's largest grid serving 65 million people

- Impact: Hard constraint on data center deployment in key US regions (Virginia, Ohio Valley); forces "Bring Your Own Generation" mandates; accelerates behind-the-meter power solutions
- Confidence: High
- Source: CNBC reporting on PJM projections (Jan 2026)

### Second-order | Senator Cotton proposes DATA Act exempting AI data centers from federal power rules
- What: 
Bill would permit AI data center firms to bypass federal electricity regulations including FERC rate regulation, reliability standards, and interconnection rules by building own energy infrastructure

- Impact: If passed, accelerates off-grid data center deployment; shifts supply chain toward self-generation (SMRs, gas turbines); threatens utility revenue models
- Confidence: Medium (bill proposed, passage uncertain)

## Causal Updates

**Inference Economics Inversion**: The crossover of inference spending surpassing training (55% vs 45%) represents a permanent regime change in AI economics. This creates new causal chain: cheaper inference → demand elasticity → total spend increases despite unit cost decreases. Companies cannot simply "save money" from cost reductions without architectural governance (rate limiting, model routing, caching).

**Energy as Primary Constraint**: Energy availability has overtaken chip supply as the binding constraint on AI capacity expansion in specific geographies (PJM region). Causal mechanism: data centers consume constant baseload power → strain grids designed for variable demand → political backlash → regulatory constraints → capacity ceiling independent of chip availability. This inverts the 2023-2024 assumption that "GPUs are the bottleneck."

**Memory-Compute Decoupling**: HBM shortage persisting through 2027 while fab capacity expands creates unusual supply chain dynamic where accelerators can be manufactured but not fully configured. This suggests memory manufacturing cycle time (2-3 years for new fabs) now gates AI hardware deployment more than logic chip capacity.

**Demand Pull-Forward Risk**: SMIC's warning about "10 years of capacity in 2 years" indicates potential Bullwhip effect in AI infrastructure. If demand was pulled forward rather than representing sustained growth trajectory, 2027-2028 could see utilization crashes and stranded assets, particularly in China's domestic AI chip sector.

## Predictions

**Q2-Q3 2026**: Expect first major announcements of data center projects delayed or relocated due to grid capacity constraints in PJM region (Virginia, Ohio). Projects with secured power agreements or co-located generation will command acquisition premiums. **Uncertainty: Medium** - political timeline is clear (midterms Nov 2026), but corporate response speed unclear.

**H2 2026**: If DATA Act or similar state-level legislation passes, expect 12-18 month lag before first off-grid data centers come online, favoring modular nuclear (if regulatory path clears) or gas turbine solutions. This would advantage companies with energy development capabilities (oil majors entering AI infrastructure). **Uncertainty: High** - depends on legislative outcomes and utility opposition.

**2027**: Memory constraint will manifest as tiering in AI accelerator market - premium tier with full HBM capacity for frontier training, constrained tier with reduced memory for inference-only workloads. Expect chip vendors to offer "inference-optimized" SKUs with less HBM at lower prices. **Uncertainty: Medium** - already visible in product positioning.

**2027-2028**: Inference cost compression (50x/year) will stabilize as architectural improvements plateau and demand catches supply. The elasticity effect (cheaper inference → usage explosion → total cost increase) will force consolidation among AI application startups unable to manage unit economics at scale. **Uncertainty: Medium-High** - depends on algorithmic efficiency breakthroughs (currently unpredictable).
