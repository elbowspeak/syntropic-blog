### Geopolitics | SCOTUS Strikes Down IEEPA Tariffs — Major Trade Architecture Shift Effective Today

- **What:** 
On February 20, 2026, the Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, held in *Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump* that the IEEPA does not authorize the president to impose tariffs.
 
The White House responded by replacing the IEEPA tariffs with a temporary 10% ad valorem tariff under Section 122 of the Trade Act, with Trump announcing intentions to raise it to 15%.

- **Impact (1st degree):** 
Non-IEEPA tariffs — including Section 232 tariffs on semiconductors — are explicitly unaffected and remain in force.
 
For the chip industry, including TSMC, the challenge is not simply tariff rates, but the combined impact of national security frameworks, export controls, and subsidy policies — with technology transfers and US fabs aimed at long-term strategic positioning.

- **Impact (2nd degree):** 
In the short term, firms will be aggressively seeking refunds on tariffs paid in 2025, which has large revenue effects and uncertain distributional effects.
 
Even if tariffs are lifted, "de-concentrated" supply chain structures are unlikely to disappear, particularly on semiconductors, within the US–China strategic competition framework.

### Geopolitics | US–Taiwan Agreement on Reciprocal Trade — Semiconductor Supply Chain Realignment Formalized

- **What:** 
The US and Taiwan signed the Agreement on Reciprocal Trade (ART), which will reduce or eliminate most tariff and non-tariff barriers — a companion to an investment agreement for $500 billion in new US investment, much focused on the semiconductor industry and AI-adjacent industries.

- **Impact (1st degree):** 
Taiwan companies will significantly increase investments in the semiconductor supply chain, electronics manufacturing services (including AI applications), energy, and other sectors in the United States, with the US providing preferential tariff treatment to Taiwan in the Section 232 semiconductor investigation.

- **Impact (2nd degree):** 
Taiwan will align its export controls with the US Foreign Direct Product Rule (FDPR) on semiconductors and equipment, and will enter into no agreements with the PRC regarding technologies such as AI, biotechnology, and quantum computing.

- **Confidence:** High

### Compute | ASML EUV Source Power Hits 1,000W — 50% Wafer Throughput Uplift Projected

- **What:** 
ASML has achieved a major milestone — their EUV lithography machines can now produce 1,000 watts of usable EUV light using laser-produced plasma, surpassing their original 2025 plan to double power from 600 watts, and performing as needed under realistic customer conditions at TSMC, Intel, and Samsung.

- **Impact (1st degree):** 
Higher EUV source power directly translates to faster lithography processing speeds — current systems handle approximately 220 wafers per hour, but the 1,000-watt upgrade could push this to approximately 330 wafers per hour, a 50% increase.
 
The roadmap continues to 1,500 watts with potential for 2,000 watts.

- **Confidence:** Medium (analysis piece, not an ASML press release; exact timeline for volume deployment not confirmed)
- **Source:** [247 Wall St.](https://247wallst.com/investing/2026/02/23/is-asml-about-to-unleash-a-50-ai-chip-output-explosion-by-2030/)

### Compute | Semiconductor Supply Crunch Deepening — Server CPUs, NAND, HBM All Constrained

- **What:** 
The semiconductor industry is in the midst of a massive supply crisis — Intel and AMD are warning customers in China of significant delays in server CPU supply, with waiting times of up to six months now common even outside China.

- **Impact (1st degree):** 
Enterprise SSD prices have doubled in some cases since the end of 2025, with TrendForce forecasting a further NAND price increase of up to 38% for Q1 2026.
 
The surge in AI spending has also triggered a shortage of high-bandwidth memory (HBM), with tight supply expected to persist for years as new capacity takes time to build and qualify.

- **Impact (2nd degree):** 
Global memory supply shortages are forcing PC and server vendors to pass higher component costs on to customers, with Lenovo notifying North American partners of planned price adjustments on selected commercial client and server products from March 2026.

### Models | DeepSeek V4 — 1T-Parameter Open Model at Fraction of Western Inference Cost

- **What:** 
DeepSeek's V4 model launched mid-February 2026 with 1 trillion total parameters, 1-million-token context windows, and three architectural innovations that could redefine AI economics.

- **Impact (1st degree):** 
Internal benchmarks claim 80%+ SWE-bench performance at 10-40x lower inference costs than Western competitors, and the model runs on dual RTX 4090s with weights open-sourced under Apache 2.0 licensing.

- **Impact (2nd degree):** 
DeepSeek reverted to NVIDIA accelerators for V4 training while keeping Huawei hardware for inference — revealing both the current limits of Chinese domestic chips and a pragmatic approach to whatever works.
 Note: Benchmark claims are internal and not yet independently verified.
- **Confidence:** Medium (sourced from Introl blog, internal benchmarks unverified by third parties)

### Deployment | Enterprise AI Billing Friction Becoming Structural Barrier to Adoption

- **What:** 
AI doesn't charge per employee — it charges per token, per API call, per inference cycle, per autonomous workflow — and as enterprises accelerate from pilots to production-scale deployments, they're discovering that traditional SaaS commercial infrastructure doesn't translate cleanly to systems that meter value by computation.

- **Impact (1st degree):** 
According to Zylo's 2026 SaaS Management Index, organizations spent an average of $1.2M on AI-native apps — a 108% year-over-year increase.

- **Confidence:** Medium

### Second-Order | Energy | Deloitte Projects 30x US AI Data Center Power Demand Growth by 2035

- **What:** 
Deloitte estimates that power demand from AI data centers in the United States could grow more than thirtyfold by 2035, reaching 123 gigawatts — up from 4 gigawatts in 2024 — as AI data centers require far more energy per square foot than traditional data centers.

- **Impact:** Structural constraint on AI infrastructure scaling; accelerates nuclear, gas peaker, and grid buildout investment.
- **Confidence:** Medium (long-range forecast)

## Causal Updates

1. **SCOTUS IEEPA ruling → Section 232 semiconductor tariffs now the dominant trade instrument.** IEEPA's invalidation paradoxically consolidates power in the more durable (and judiciary-survived) Section 232 authority, which already imposes 25% tariffs on advanced logic semiconductors. The effective tariff regime for chips is narrower but harder to remove.

2. **ASML EUV throughput gains → reduces need for new fab construction.** 
ASML is propelling the technology to the next level, which could reshape production capabilities without requiring massive new investments in factory space or equipment while unleashing a torrent of new chip output over the next few years.
 This is a deflationary force on the cost of leading-edge capacity.

3. **DeepSeek V4 efficiency → inference infrastructure pressure shifts from raw GPU count to memory bandwidth and caching.** 
Engram's approach to context handling emphasizes memory hierarchy over raw compute — suggesting future training infrastructure might prioritize high-bandwidth memory and efficient caching over peak FLOPS.


4. **HBM shortage → Lenovo passes costs to enterprise buyers now, with other OEMs likely to follow** before H1 2026 ends.

## Predictions

| Prediction | Confidence | Timeframe |
|---|---|---|
| Section 232 semiconductor tariff threats will be used aggressively as leverage to extract fab investment commitments from Samsung/SK Hynix | High | Q1-Q2 2026 |
| NAND/HBM price pressures push enterprise server refresh cycles to H2 2026 or beyond | High | 6 months |
| Additional open-weight frontier models from China (DeepSeek V4 and successors) will collapse inference API pricing for non-agentic workloads | Medium | 6-12 months |
| ASML 1,500W EUV milestone accelerates TSMC N2 capacity ramp beyond current guidance | Medium | 12-18 months |
| US–Taiwan ART investment commitments begin yielding groundbreakings at US semiconductor industrial parks | Medium | 12-24 months |

## Investment Implications

### Becoming More Attractive
- **ASML (ASML):** EUV throughput roadmap (1,000W → 1,500W → 2,000W) means existing installed base customers will pay for upgrades before buying new machines — high-margin, recurring revenue. Virtual monopoly strengthened.
- **TSMC (TSM):** 
The US–Taiwan investment deal, with $500 billion in new investment much focused on the semiconductor industry,
 de-risks geopolitical overhang and cements TSMC's role as the indispensable AI chip manufacturer. 
Analysts estimate 25% annual earnings growth over the next 3-5 years, yet shares still trade at just under 25x this year's estimates.

- **HBM suppliers (SK Hynix, Samsung):** 
The surge in AI spending has triggered HBM shortages, with tight supply expected to persist for years.
 Samsung has reclaimed the DRAM market lead and is targeting HBM4 first-mover status.
- **Memory pricing beneficiaries broadly:** NAND flash and DDR5 RAM moving into structural seller's market through at least 2027.
- **AI FinOps / cost observability platforms:** The enterprise billing chaos signal is a direct TAM expansion event for tools that map AI inference spend to business outcomes.

### Becoming Less Attractive / Risks to Watch
- **Generic cloud inference providers:** DeepSeek V4's open-source 1T-parameter model at claimed 10-40x lower cost (unverified) will compress API pricing and commoditize mid-tier inference. Margin pressure for AWS Bedrock, Azure OpenAI, GCP Vertex on commodity workloads.
- **US importers of semiconductors under IEEPA:** 
Firms will aggressively seek refunds on tariffs paid in 2025
 — creating cash flow uncertainty and legal complexity, but also potential windfalls that aren't priced in.
- **Enterprises locking in long-term AI SaaS contracts now:** 
AI pricing models are evolving faster than buyers can keep up
 — locking into high-tier bundled AI subscriptions today risks paying peak prices before open-model commoditization hits.
- **Chip startups dependent on IEEPA tariff protection:** The policy architecture is now less predictable with the Section 122 replacement being temporary (150-day limit) and requiring Congressional renewal.

> ⚠️ **Valuation disconnect to watch:** The market may not be fully pricing in the deflationary effect of ASML's throughput improvements on leading-edge capacity scarcity. If wafer output at existing fabs increases 50% without new fab capex, the "supply scarcity = pricing power" thesis for some AI infrastructure stocks weakens materially over a 24-36
