### ðŸ”´ Compute | Metaâ€“AMD 6GW Landmark Deal: The Nvidia Monopoly Cracks

- **What:** 
AMD agreed to sell up to $60 billion worth of AI chips to Meta Platforms over five years in a deal that allows the Facebook owner to purchase as much as 10% of the chip firm.
 
AMD will provide Meta with six gigawatts of chips, starting with one gigawatt of the company's upcoming MI450 flagship GPU design in the second half of 2026.

- **Impact (1st degree):** 
This is a critical development for AMD, which is far behind Nvidia in the AI chip market. Nvidia controls roughly 90% of the market with a $4.66 trillion valuation, while AMD is valued at $320 billion.
 
The rally saw AMD's stock climb as much as 14% in late February 2026 trading.

- **Impact (2nd degree):** 
The deal highlights a shift in how the industry measures scale; in 2026, the primary metric for AI leadership has moved from simple "chip counts" to "gigawatts of deployed power," reflecting the severe energy constraints currently facing the global data center market.

- **Confidence:** High â€” multiple major outlets including Bloomberg, Reuters, CNBC confirmed

### ðŸ”´ Compute | Metaâ€“Nvidia Expanded Deal: Millions of GPUs + Vera Rubin Commitment

- **What:** 
Meta will use millions of Nvidia chips in its artificial intelligence data centers, including Nvidia's new standalone CPUs and next-generation Vera Rubin systems, in a sweeping new deal announced days before the AMD pact.
 
Meta has plans for 30 data centers, including two largest under construction: the Prometheus 1-gigawatt site in New Albany, Ohio, and the 5-gigawatt Hyperion site in Richland Parish, Louisiana.

- **Impact (1st degree):** Meta is simultaneously locking up both Nvidia AND AMD supply â€” a dual-vendor strategy that signals compute scarcity is existential. 
As chip analyst Ben Bajarin of Creative Strategies noted: "Meta is in a unique position to control the full stack... It's just a punctuation point on the fact that we are compute constrained, and deals will be done across the board."

- **Confidence:** High

### ðŸŸ  Compute | NVIDIA GTC 2026 (March 15): "Chips the World Has Never Seen"

- **What:** 
Jensen Huang has stated: "At next month's GTC 2026, we'll unveil a chip that will surprise the world," also quoted as saying NVIDIA has prepared "a few new chips the world has never seen before."
 
Speculation points to the Rubin architecture, and even a completely new Feynman line with 3D stacking technology.

- **Impact (1st degree):** 
The Rubin platform delivers up to 10x reduction in inference token cost and 4x reduction in number of GPUs to train MoE models, compared with the Blackwell platform.
 Any further surprise announcement above Rubin would reset competitive dynamics again.
- **Confidence:** Medium (announcement confirmed; chip content speculative until March 15)

### ðŸŸ  Compute | TSMC Aggressive Capacity Expansion â€” 2nm + Advanced Packaging

- **What:** 
TSMC is launching a massive capacity expansion in Taiwan, building up to 10 new fabs by 2026 to meet AI chip demand, focusing on 2nm and future 1.4nm nodes.
 
Two key advanced packaging facilities â€” AP5B in Taichung and AP7 P1 in Chiayi â€” are both targeted for completion in 2026.

- **Impact (1st degree):** 
TSMC's N3 process already faces capacity constraints â€” the node also supports Apple's latest processors and AMD's MI400 series, creating competition for advanced wafer capacity. NVIDIA secured long-term capacity agreements, but production ceiling likely limits 2026 output to 200,000â€“300,000 Rubin GPUs.

- **Confidence:** High

### ðŸŸ  Compute | HBM Supply Crunch: Multi-Year Constraint Confirmed

- **What:** 
The surge in spending has triggered a shortage of high-bandwidth memory (HBM), a critical high-end component that enables advanced AI computing. The tight supply of HBM could persist for years, as new capacity takes time to build and qualify.
 
SK Hynix and Samsung began HBM4 mass production in Q4 2025, but yields remain below mature HBM3e levels. Each Rubin GPU requires 288GB of HBM4.

- **Impact (1st degree):** HBM is now the binding constraint on GPU shipments â€” not fab wafer starts.
- **Impact (2nd degree):** 
Data centers must deploy direct-to-chip liquid cooling infrastructure before accepting Rubin systems â€” the transition represents significant capital expenditure for facilities designed around air cooling.

- **Confidence:** High

### ðŸŸ¡ Second-Order | Trump Targets Taiwan Chip Industry Post-Tariff Ruling

- **What:** 
President Trump took aim at Taiwan's chip industry following a Supreme Court decision on tariffs, injecting new political risk into already strained semiconductor supply chains. Taiwan's role in advanced chip manufacturing makes any escalation â€” policy or rhetoric â€” material for global AI infrastructure plans.

- **Impact (2nd degree):** 
Any policy shock that adds cost, complicates cross-border production, or triggers retaliatory trade measures can ripple through pricing and availability. For startups building AI hardware or edge devices, supply volatility becomes existential.

- **Confidence:** Medium (escalatory rhetoric confirmed; policy action not yet confirmed)

### ðŸŸ¡ Second-Order | China Semiconductor Self-Sufficiency: SMIC Warns of Overcapacity Risk

- **What:** 
SMIC co-CEO Zhao Haijun warned: "Companies would love to build 10 years' worth of data center capacity within one or two years... As for what exactly these data centers will do, that hasn't been fully thought through." Moody's Ratings projects AI-related infrastructure investment would exceed $3 trillion over the next five years.

- **Impact (2nd degree):** 
As of early 2026, there were no clear teardowns of Chinese products using a 5nm part manufactured at commercial scale at SMIC
, suggesting China's domestic AI chip self-sufficiency ambitions remain aspirational at the leading edge.
- **Confidence:** High

## Causal Updates

1. **Meta dual-vendor strategy â†’ AMD ROCm ecosystem legitimization.** 
Meta's successful migration of its Llama 4 and Llama 5 models to AMD's ROCm software ecosystem provides a "green light" for other hyperscalers like Microsoft and Alphabet.
 This is the most important software-ecosystem unlock for AMD since ROCm's inception.

2. **Inference cost collapse â†’ shift from training to deployment capex.** Blackwell's 4â€“10x token cost reduction and the inference-dominant spending crossover (>55% of AI cloud budget) means the supply chain bottleneck is shifting from training clusters toward persistent inference infrastructure and HBM supply.

3. **Gigawatt-scale deals â†’ energy grid as the new binding constraint.** 
The industry has moved its primary metric from chip counts to gigawatts of deployed power
, meaning power utilities, nuclear operators, and grid interconnection firms are now upstream supply chain actors for AI compute.

4. **HBM4 yield constraints â†’ Rubin GPU shipment ceiling.** Even with full TSMC N3 production, limited HBM4 yield at SK Hynix/Samsung caps how many Rubin GPUs ship in H2 2026 â€” making HBM the decisive chokepoint, not wafer fab capacity.

## Predictions

| Prediction | Confidence |
|---|---|
| AMD captures 12â€“18% of AI accelerator market share by end of 2026, up from ~9%, driven by Meta validation unlocking other hyperscaler trials | Medium-High |
| NVIDIA announces an accelerated roadmap item (likely Rubin Ultra or early Feynman disclosure) at GTC March 15 to neutralize AMD momentum | Medium |
| HBM4 supply remains constrained through at least mid-2027; SK Hynix maintains pricing power | High |
| At least one additional hyperscaler (Microsoft or Amazon) signs a comparable equity-linked AMD supply agreement within 6 months, following Meta's template | Medium |
| Taiwan-U.S. semiconductor policy tension results in at least one delayed TSMC Arizona capacity commitment or pricing renegotiation before Q3 2026 | Medium |
| Liquid cooling retrofit demand creates a 12â€“18 month supply bottleneck for Rubin deployment independent of chip availability | Medium-High |

## Investment Implications

### ðŸŸ¢ Becoming More Attractive

**AMD (NASDAQ: AMD)**
The Meta deal is a structural re-rating event â€” not a one-off win. 
Analysts are calling this the "Milan moment" for AMD's data center business â€” a reference to the 2021 server chip breakthrough that allowed the company to begin eating into Intel's market share. By securing a deal estimated to be worth between $60 billion and $100 billion, AMD has moved from "secondary challenger" to "tier-1" hyperscale platform provider.
 The equity warrant structure also aligns Meta's incentives to ensure AMD succeeds. Key watch: ROCm software adoption velocity and H2 2026 MI450 shipment execution.

**HBM Memory (SK Hynix, Samsung)**

The surge in spending has triggered a shortage of HBM â€” a critical component for advanced AI computing. The tight supply of HBM could persist for years.
 SK Hynix is the most exposed beneficiary given its HBM4 head-start.

**Liquid Cooling / Data Center Infrastructure (Vertiv, Schneider Electric)**

Vera Rubin NVL72 requires 100% liquid cooling. Organizations planning Rubin deployments should initiate infrastructure projects immediately â€” the 12â€“18 month construction timeline for liquid cooling retrofits aligns poorly with H2 2026 Rubin availability.
 Liquid cooling vendors have effectively locked in multi-year backlog.

**Specialized AI Cloud (CoreWeave, Lambda)**

Among the first cloud providers to deploy Vera Rubin-based instances will be AWS
