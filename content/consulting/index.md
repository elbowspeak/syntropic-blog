Through [S37](https://s37.ai), I help organizations make better decisions under uncertainty.

## What I do

**Competitive Intelligence.** Deep, structured analysis of your competitive landscape. Not surface-level market reports, but actionable intelligence that changes how you position and compete.

**Strategic Advisory.** Applying Active Inference and systems thinking to organizational challenges. Helping leadership teams see the patterns they're embedded in, and find leverage points for change.

**AI Integration.** Building intelligence systems that actually work with how organizations think and decide, not just bolt-on automation.

## How I work

I prefer deep engagements over broad ones. A small number of clients where I can understand the full context, build real models of the problem space, and deliver insights that compound over time.

Typical engagements run 3-6 months. I work directly with founders and executive teams.
