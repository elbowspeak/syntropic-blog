Intelligence OS shows you where uncertainty and risk live in your organization, market ecosystem, and competitors. The platform applies causal modeling and active inference to reduce surprise and make increasingly accurate predictions.

## Applications

It can be applied to any problem that can be probabilistically profiled:

- Organizational underperformance
- Operational bottlenecks
- Go-to-market strategy
- AI adoption planning
- Competitive positioning

## How it works

The system builds a causal model of the relevant domain, identifies the variables with the highest uncertainty, and recommends actions that reduce uncertainty. As conditions change, the model updates. You get continual predictions about what you, your market, and your competitors will be doing next week.

## Current state

Alpha. The core modeling approach is proven through client engagements at S37. Now generalizing the architecture into a standalone product.
