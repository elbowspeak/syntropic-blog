S37 is my consulting practice. I work with founders and executive teams on competitive intelligence, strategic advisory, and AI integration.

The core thesis: organizations are prediction machines. The ones that survive are the ones that minimize surprise efficiently. Active Inference gives us a formal framework for understanding and improving how organizations sense, model, and act.

## Current focus

- Deep competitive intelligence for B2B SaaS and insurtech companies
- Building custom intelligence systems that integrate with how teams actually work
- Strategic advisory for organizations facing complexity walls
